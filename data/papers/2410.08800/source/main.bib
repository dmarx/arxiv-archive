This work shows that useful data can be synthetically generated even for tasks that cannot be solved directly by LLMs: for problems with structured outputs, it is possible to prompt an LLM to perform the task in the reverse direction, by generating plausible input text for a target output structure. Leveraging this asymmetry in task difficulty makes it possible to produce large-scale, high-quality data for complex tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on closed information extraction, where collecting ground-truth data is challenging, and no satisfactory dataset exists to date. We synthetically generate a dataset of 1.8M data points, establish its superior quality compared to existing datasets in a human evaluation, and use it to finetune small models (220M and 770M parameters), termed SynthIE, that outperform the prior state of the art (with equal model size) by a substantial margin of 57 absolute points in micro-F1 and 79 points in macro-F1. Code, data, and models are available at anonymous.",

abstract = {Data augmentation for training supervised models has achieved great results in different areas. With the popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), a research area has emerged focused on applying LLMs for text data augmentation. This approach is particularly beneficial for low-resource tasks, whereby the availability of labeled data is very scarce. Dataset search is an information retrieval task that aims to retrieve relevant datasets based on user queries. However, due to the lack of labeled data tailored explicitly for this task, developing accurate retrieval models becomes challenging. In this paper, we target LLMs to create training examples for retrieval models in the dataset search task. Specifically, we propose a new pipeline that generates synthetic queries from dataset descriptions using LLMs. The query-description pairs are utilized to fine-tune dense retrieval approaches for re-ranking, which we assume as soft matches to our task. We evaluated our pipeline using fine-tuned embedding models for semantic search over dataset search benchmarks (NTCIR and ACORDAR). We tuned these models in the dataset search task using the synthetic data generated by our solution and compared their performance with the original models. The results show the models tuned on the synthetic data statistically outperform the baselines at different normalized discounted cumulative gain levels.}
