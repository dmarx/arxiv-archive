  "abstract": "Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as\nmachine learning experts, may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how\nmachine learning can be a powerful tool in reducing greenhouse gas emissions\nand helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids to disaster\nmanagement, we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled\nby machine learning, in collaboration with other fields. Our recommendations\nencompass exciting research questions as well as promising business\nopportunities. We call on the machine learning community to join the global\neffort against climate change.",
