  "abstract": "We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training a\ntransformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current\nlarge language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the\nrecent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training\ndata constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to\nover 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for\ncompute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens\nshould be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of\ntraining tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a\npredicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget\nas Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4$\\times$ more more data. Chinchilla\nuniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1\n(178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream\nevaluation tasks. This also means that Chinchilla uses substantially less\ncompute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage.\nAs a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5%\non the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher.",
