  "abstract": "This paper presents Diffusion Forcing, a new training paradigm where a\ndiffusion model is trained to denoise a set of tokens with independent\nper-token noise levels. We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative\nmodeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or\nseveral future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown\nto combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as\nvariable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion\nmodels, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our\nmethod offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out\nsequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training\nhorizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that\nuniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal\narchitecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and\nplanning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to\noptimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of\ntokens drawn from the true joint distribution.
