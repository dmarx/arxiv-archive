  "abstract": "We present a method for computing free-energy differences using thermodynamic\nintegration with a neural network potential that interpolates between two\ntarget Hamiltonians. The interpolation is defined at the sample distribution\nlevel, and the neural network potential is optimized to match the corresponding\nequilibrium potential at every intermediate time-step. Once the interpolating\npotentials and samples are well-aligned, the free-energy difference can be\nestimated using (neural) thermodynamic integration. To target molecular\nsystems, we simultaneously couple Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions\nand model the rigid-body rotation of molecules. We report accurate results for\nseveral benchmark systems: a Lennard-Jones particle in a Lennard-Jones fluid,\nas well as the insertion of both water and methane solutes in a water solvent\nat atomistic resolution using a simple three-body neural-network potential.",
