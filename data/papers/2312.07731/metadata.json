  "authors": "Shawn Shan, Stanley Wu, Haitao Zheng, Ben Y. Zhao",
  "abstract": "Recent work proposed a new mechanism to remove protective perturbation added\nby Glaze in order to again enable mimicry of art styles from images protected\nby Glaze. Despite promising results shown in the original paper, our own tests\nwith the authors' code demonstrated several limitations of the proposed\npurification approach. The main limitations are 1) purification has a limited\neffect when tested on artists that are not well-known historical artists\nalready embedded in original training data, 2) problems in evaluation metrics,\nand 3) collateral damage on mimicry result for clean images. We believe these\nlimitations should be carefully considered in order to understand real world\nusability of the purification attack.",
