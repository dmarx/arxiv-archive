  "title": "Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Generative Diffusion Models",
  "authors": "Gabriel Raya, Luca Ambrogioni",
  "abstract": "Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a leading approach for\ngenerating high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of\nthese models exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking that divides the\ngenerative dynamics into two distinct phases: 1) A linear steady-state dynamics\naround a central fixed-point and 2) an attractor dynamics directed towards the\ndata manifold. These two \"phases\" are separated by the change in stability of\nthe central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being\nresponsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical\nand empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early\ndynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early\nfluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight,\nwe propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves\nmodel performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while\nalso increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA\nimages). Our work offers a new way to understand the generative dynamics of\ndiffusion models that has the potential to bring about higher performance and\nless biased fast-samplers.",
