\multirow{5}{*}{Data Preparation} &The community stands to benefit greatly from increased efforts on open-source data exploration tools. \\
& \cellcolor[gray]{0.9} Open-source data exploration tools allow for retrospective analysis of datasets. \\
& Consolidating on a standardized format for data storage and processing will give developers more time to focus on developing infrastructure. \\
& \cellcolor[gray]{0.9} Developing data-centric benchmarks can catalyze progress. \\
& Data preparation tools should consider not only English-centric data, but non-English and low-resource languages. \\
\midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{Data Documentation} & Data documentation is essential for reproducibility, avoiding misuse, and helping downstream users build constructively on prior work. \\
% Data Documentation \& Release & Placeholder. \\
& \cellcolor[gray]{0.9} The documentation process should be started early, as data is collected and processed. \\
& For datasets with multiple stakeholders, or derived from community efforts, it is important to appropriately proactively organize its access, licenses, and stewardship. \\
\midrule
\multirow{4}{*}{Model Training} & More resources, especially non-English ones, for lowering the barrier to entry for less technical developers are needed. \\
& \cellcolor[gray]{0.9} More standardized and centralized resources, especially cross-modality, should be focused on in the future. \\
& Other options for massively collaborative model development should be pursued. \\
\midrule
\multirow{5}{*}{Environmental Impact} & Transparency from consumer-level API providers, into query-level energy and environmental usage measures. \\
& \cellcolor[gray]{0.9}Transparency from hardware makers and data centers, into fine-grained energy and environmental usage measures. \\

& Placeholder \\
\midrule
\multirow{3}{*}{Model Release} & \cellcolor[gray]{0.9}Models should be released with accompanying documentation \emph{and} easy-to-run code for training, evaluation and inference. \\
& Developers should be thoughtful about the type of license to use for artifacts and whether to include behavioral use clauses. \\
&  \cellcolor[gray]{0.9} Frameworks for monitoring and shaping model usage have become more prevalent; however, more tooling and support is needed. \\
