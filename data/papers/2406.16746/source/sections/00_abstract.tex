Foundation model development attracts a rapidly expanding body of contributors, scientists, and applications.
To help shape \emph{responsible development practices}, we introduce the Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text, vision, and speech modalities.
We draw on a large body of prior work to survey resources (\emph{e.g.} software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical tools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model release, licensing and deployment practices.
We hope this curated collection of resources helps guide more responsible development.
The process of curating this list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what tools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices.
We find that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility and transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue to dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of systems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are assessed in context.  %\TODO{Finish one more point on systems vs models?}
% We hope this survey and review of resources will provide a practical guide to developers and a compass for meaningful future work in responsible AI.
