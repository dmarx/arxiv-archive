  "abstract": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) excel across diverse tasks involving\nconcrete images from natural scenes. However, their ability to interpret\nabstract figures, such as geometry shapes and scientific plots, remains limited\ndue to a scarcity of training datasets in scientific domains. To fill this gap,\nwe introduce Multimodal ArXiv, consisting of ArXivCap and ArXivQA, for\nenhancing LVLMs scientific comprehension. ArXivCap is a figure-caption dataset\ncomprising 6.4M images and 3.9M captions, sourced from 572K ArXiv papers\nspanning various scientific domains. Drawing from ArXivCap, we introduce\nArXivQA, a question-answering dataset generated by prompting GPT-4V based on\nscientific figures. ArXivQA greatly enhances open-sourced LVLMs' mathematical\nreasoning capabilities, achieving a 10.4\\% absolute accuracy gain on a\nmultimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, employing ArXivCap,\nwe devise four vision-to-text tasks for benchmarking LVLMs. Evaluation results\nwith state-of-the-art LVLMs underscore their struggle with the nuanced\nsemantics of academic figures, while domain-specific training yields\nsubstantial performance gains. Our error analysis uncovers misinterpretations\nof visual context, recognition errors, and the production of overly simplified\ncaptions by current LVLMs, shedding light on future improvements.",
