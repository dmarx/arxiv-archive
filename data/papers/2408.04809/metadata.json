  "abstract": "In this paper, we overview one promising avenue of progress at the\nmathematical foundation of deep learning: the connection between deep networks\nand function approximation by affine splines (continuous piecewise linear\nfunctions in multiple dimensions). In particular, we will overview work over\nthe past decade on understanding certain geometrical properties of a deep\nnetwork's affine spline mapping, in particular how it tessellates its input\nspace. As we will see, the affine spline connection and geometrical viewpoint\nprovide a powerful portal through which to view, analyze, and improve the inner\nworkings of a deep network.",
