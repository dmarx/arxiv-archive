\section{Dataset Licenses \& Terms}
\label{app:licenses-and-terms}

\paragraph{Detailed taxonomy}
We code the legal restrictions placed on use of datasets along two axes. First, we identify whether a dataset's license permits commercial use (``Commercial'' in Table \ref{tab:license_terms_breakdown}), only non-commercial / academic use (``NC / Acad''), or does not clearly specify what is permitted (``Unspecified''). 
The latter category includes datasets for which we were unable to locate a license.
Datasets which are in the public domain and not subject to a license are counted as commercially usable.
Second, we annotate the contractual or terms-of-use restrictions placed on dataset use by the source of each dataset. There are four levels, defined in Table \ref{tab:license_terms_breakdown}. Note that the Model Closed status can only apply to datasets that are AI-generated, at least in part.
Some datasets can carry both Model Closed and Source Closed status, but we count the Model Closed first for simplicity.

\paragraph{Detailed breakdown}
Tables \ref{tab:license_terms_breakdown} and \ref{tab:license_terms_breakdown_count} present crosstabs of these two dimensions, according to respectively the total amount of content and the number of datasets. The most notable finding, as discussed in the main text, is the frequency of clashing restriction status between licenses and terms. By amount of content, fully 73.0\% of text content, 55.0\% of speech content, and 21.6\% of video content is subject to a license permitting commercial use but also to terms restrictions forbidding it, or the reverse. The absolute level of restrictions is also high, with < 0.1\% of text content, 5.4\% of speech content, and 0.6\% of video content usable for commercial purposes under both licenses and terms.
