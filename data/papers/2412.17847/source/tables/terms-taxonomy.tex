\caption{\textbf{The taxonomy used to determine use restrictions on each dataset source.} Each source in a dataset is examined and fit into one of these categories. The dataset Terms are then labelled according to the strictest terms across the sources, with Model Closed and Source Closed considered stricter than Unspecified which is in turn stricter than Unrestricted.}
