We first prove that a gradient matrix can be cast as a low-rank linear combination of its forward and backward passes{'} inputs. We then develop methods to project these gradients into vocabulary items and explore the mechanics of how new information is stored in the LMs{'} neurons.",

    abstract = "We present the copy suppression motif: an algorithm implemented by attention heads in large language models that reduces loss.If i) language model components in earlier layers predict a certain token, ii) this token appears earlier in the context and iii) later attention heads in the model suppress prediction of the token, then this is copy suppression. To show the importance of copy suppression, we focus on reverse-engineering attention head 10.7 (L10H7) in GPT-2 Small. This head suppresses naive copying behavior which improves overall model calibration, which explains why multiple prior works studying certain narrow tasks found negative heads that systematically favored the wrong answer. We uncover the mechanism that the negative heads use for copy suppression with weights-based evidence and are able to explain 76.9{\%} of the impact of L10H7 in GPT-2 Small, by this motif alone.To the best of our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive description of the complete role of a component in a language model to date. One major effect of copy suppression is its role in self-repair. Self-repair refers to how ablating crucial model components results in downstream neural network parts compensating for this ablation. Copy suppression leads to self-repair: if an initial overconfident copier is ablated, then there is nothing to suppress. We show that self-repair is implemented by several mechanisms, one of which is copy suppression, which explains 39{\%} of the behavior in a narrow task. Interactive visualizations of the copy suppression phenomena may be seen at our web app https://copy-suppression.streamlit.app/.",

    abstract = "Replacing static word embeddings with contextualized word representations has yielded significant improvements on many NLP tasks. However, just how contextual are the contextualized representations produced by models such as ELMo and BERT? Are there infinitely many context-specific representations for each word, or are words essentially assigned one of a finite number of word-sense representations? For one, we find that the contextualized representations of all words are not isotropic in any layer of the contextualizing model. While representations of the same word in different contexts still have a greater cosine similarity than those of two different words, this self-similarity is much lower in upper layers. This suggests that upper layers of contextualizing models produce more context-specific representations, much like how upper layers of LSTMs produce more task-specific representations. In all layers of ELMo, BERT, and GPT-2, on average, less than 5{\%} of the variance in a word{'}s contextualized representations can be explained by a static embedding for that word, providing some justification for the success of contextualized representations.",

    abstract = "The representation degeneration problem is a phenomenon that is widely observed among self-supervised learning methods based on Transformers. In NLP, it takes the form of anisotropy, a singular property of hidden representations which makes them unexpectedly close to each other in terms of angular distance (cosine-similarity). Some recent works tend to show that anisotropy is a consequence of optimizing the cross-entropy loss on long-tailed distributions of tokens. We show in this paper that anisotropy can also be observed empirically in language models with specific objectives that should not suffer directly from the same consequences. We also show that the anisotropy problem extends to Transformers trained on other modalities. Our observations tend to demonstrate that anisotropy might actually be inherent to Transformers-based models.",
