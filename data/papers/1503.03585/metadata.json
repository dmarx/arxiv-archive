  "abstract": "A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets\nusing highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning,\nsampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally\ntractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both\nflexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium\nstatistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a\ndata distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn\na reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly\nflexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to\nrapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative\nmodels with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute\nconditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We\nadditionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.",
