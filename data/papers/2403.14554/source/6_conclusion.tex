\section{Conclusion}

We proposed a simple yet powerful surface representation with many advantages over current representations together with a method to extract it from images. One limitation of our implementation is the simple deformation model as it is piecewise linear. It should be however simple to replace it with a more sophisticated, physics-based deformation model. Another limitation is that our models are larger than vanilla Gaussian Splatting models since we have to include the barycentric coordinates and the mesh vertices.  Recent works about compressing 3DGS could help.

We believe that the Frosting representation can be useful beyond image-based rendering. It could for example be used in more general Computer Graphics applications to render complex materials in real-time.
