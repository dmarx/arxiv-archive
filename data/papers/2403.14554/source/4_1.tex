\subsection{Forward Process: From Volume to Surface}
\label{subsec:forward-process}

We start by optimizing an unconstrained Gaussian Splatting representation for a short period of time to let Gaussians position themselves. We will refer to such Gaussians as \emph{unconstrained}. We save these Gaussians aside, and apply the regularization term from SuGaR to enforce the alignment of the Gaussians with the real surface. We will refer to these Gaussians as \emph{regularized}.

Once we obtain the regularized Gaussians, we extract a surface mesh from the Gaussian Splatting representation. This surface mesh serves as a basis for our representation. Like SuGaR~\cite{guedon2023sugar}, we then sample points on the visible level set of the Gaussian splatting density function, and apply Poisson reconstruction. 

In the supplementary material, we describe our technique to automatically estimate a good value for a critical hyperparameter used by Poisson reconstruction, namely the octree depth $D$. As we will show in the Experiments section, selecting the right value for $D$ when applying Poisson reconstruction can drastically improve both the quality of the mesh and the rendering performance of our model. Figure~\ref{fig:mesh-comparison} illustrates this point.
