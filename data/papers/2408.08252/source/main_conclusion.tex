\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-2mm}
We propose a novel inference-time algorithm, \alg, for optimizing downstream reward functions in pre-trained diffusion models that eliminate the need to construct differentiable proxy models. Future works include applications in other domains, such as protein sequence optimization \citep{gruver2023protein,alamdari2023protein,watson2023novo} and 3D molecule generation \citep{xu2023geometric}.  



\section*{Acknowledgement} 

We appreciate the feedback from Christian A. Naesseth. He pointed out the connection between our work and the twisted diffusion sampler, and noted our algorithm is close to an instantiation of nested-IS SMC in our context \citep{naesseth2019elements,naesseth2015nested}.
