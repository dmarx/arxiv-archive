\label{section:results}

We performed an extensive series of evaluations of Llama 3, investigating the performance of: \textbf{(1)} the pre-trained language model, \textbf{(2)} the post-trained language model, and \textbf{(3)} the safety characteristics of Llama 3. We present the results of these evaluations in separate subsections below.
