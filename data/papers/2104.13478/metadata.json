  "abstract": "The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and\nmachine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many\nhigh-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such\nas computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with\nappropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is\nbuilt from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of\nrepresentation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical,\nfeatures capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and\nsecond, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented\nas backpropagation.\n  While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation\nproblem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential\npre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and\nstructure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these\nregularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied\nthroughout a wide spectrum of applications.\n  Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's\nErlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common\nmathematical framework to study the most successful neural network\narchitectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand,\nit gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into\nneural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures\nyet to be invented.",
