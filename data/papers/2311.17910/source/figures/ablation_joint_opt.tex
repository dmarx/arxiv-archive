    \caption{\textbf{Ablation study} showing the impact of jointly optimizing the human and scene models. Left column (a) shows the result of our method HUGS with joint optimization of human and scene Gaussians. Right column (b) shows optimizing the scene first by masking out the human regions and then optimizing the human Gaussians.}
