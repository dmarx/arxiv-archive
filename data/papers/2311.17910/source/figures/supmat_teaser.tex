		\captionof{figure}{\textbf{Human Gaussian Splats (\acronym)} is a neural rendering framework that trains on 50-100 frames of a monocular video containing a human in a scene. HUGS enables novel view rendering with novel human poses at \textbf{60 FPS} by learning a disentangled representation that can also render the human in other scenes.  \textcolor{magenta}{\textbf{*}Main submission indicates runtime speed as 32 FPS. During SupMat submission we have found out a bug causing slow performance. After resolving the issue, actual speed becomes 60 FPS.} }
