  "title": "Poincar\u00e9 Embeddings for Learning Hierarchical Representations",
  "authors": "Maximilian Nickel, Douwe Kiela",
  "abstract": "Representation learning has become an invaluable approach for learning from\nsymbolic data such as text and graphs. However, while complex symbolic datasets\noften exhibit a latent hierarchical structure, state-of-the-art methods\ntypically learn embeddings in Euclidean vector spaces, which do not account for\nthis property. For this purpose, we introduce a new approach for learning\nhierarchical representations of symbolic data by embedding them into hyperbolic\nspace -- or more precisely into an n-dimensional Poincar\\'e ball. Due to the\nunderlying hyperbolic geometry, this allows us to learn parsimonious\nrepresentations of symbolic data by simultaneously capturing hierarchy and\nsimilarity. We introduce an efficient algorithm to learn the embeddings based\non Riemannian optimization and show experimentally that Poincar\\'e embeddings\noutperform Euclidean embeddings significantly on data with latent hierarchies,\nboth in terms of representation capacity and in terms of generalization\nability.",
