  "abstract": "The Maximal Update Parametrization ($\\mu$P) aims to make the optimal hyperparameters (HPs) of a model independent of its size, allowing them to be swept using a cheap proxy model rather than the full-size target model. We present a new scheme, u-$\\mu$P, which improves upon $\\mu$P by combining it with Unit Scaling, a method for designing models that makes them easy to train in low-precision. The two techniques have a natural affinity: $\\mu$P ensures that the scale of activations is independent of model size, and Unit Scaling ensures that activations, weights and gradients begin training with a scale of one. This synthesis opens the door to a simpler scheme, whose default values are near-optimal. This in turn facilitates a more efficient sweeping strategy, with u-$\\mu$P models reaching a loss that is equal to or lower than comparable $\\mu$P models and working out-of-the-box in FP8.",
