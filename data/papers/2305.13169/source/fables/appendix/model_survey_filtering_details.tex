\textsc{Model} & \textsc{Filtering Details}\\
\midrule
\textsc{Bert} & ``ignore lists, tables, and headers''\\
\textsc{GPT-2} & removed Wikipedia \\
\textsc{RoBerta} & CC filtered to news and Winograd-like subsets\\
\textsc{XLNet} & ``heuristics to aggressively filter out short or low-quality articles''\\
\textsc{T5} & Heuristic quality, toxicity, and length filters; code removed \\
% July 2020 release, 7\% multilingual text according to section 3.3
\textsc{GPT-3} & Filtered based on similarity to high-quality reference corpora. \\
% GPT-J: Aug 2021. Pile: Dec 2020.
\textsc{GPT-J/Neo} & Uses fasttext classifier on Pile-CC, with OpenWebText2 as the high-quality reference. \\
% Dec 2021. Tox filter because they cite T5's C4 directly.
\textsc{GLaM} & Classifier with Wikipedia, books and selected websites as positive examples \\
% Jan 20, 2022.
\textsc{LaMDA} & ``LaMDA SSI and safety discriminators are also used to score and filter 2.5M turns of dialog data sampled from the
pre-training dataset'', which are then trained on.  \\
% Feb 2022 Release. 
% Filtering: (section B.2) and "we
% filtered out all files larger than 1MB or with lines longer than 1000 characters, to exclude automatically
% generated code. We also removed duplicates of the same file, ignoring whitespace in comparisons"
\textsc{AlphaCode} &  Filtering heuristics to exclude automatically generated code \\
% March 2022
\textsc{CodeGen} & Heuristic filters for code quality \\
% march 2022 release
\textsc{Chinchilla} & Heuristic-based quality filtering, SafeSearch filter \\
% June 2022. Filters: Uses 5% PaLM data (same filters), and 95% acad.
\textsc{Minerva} & Same as PaLM for non-academic data \\
% Published Nov 2022. Released July 2022. 29% English data.
% 62% of docs come from ROOTS sec 2: (11% code, 10% academic, 10% books, 5% wiki) , then 38% OSCAR (ML CC)
\textsc{BLOOM} & heuristic-based quality and porn filtering\\
% October 2022 release, Appendix D says data collected up to 2021. 22% multilingual
\textsc{PaLM} & Same as GlaM \\
% Nov 16 2022. Filters: We apply several quality filters, including excluding papers from journals with certain keywords, and also
% excluding papers with a low journal impact factor.
\textsc{Galactica} & Apply several quality filters: exclude papers from journals with certain keywords or low journal impact factor \\
% May 2022, appendix C.2 doesn't give enough info for percentages
% \textsc{OPT} &  &  &  &  &  & & Pile & \ &  &  &  & ? \\
% Feb 2023 release. data up to 2020. Used multilingual wikipedia (~4% all data)
\textsc{LLaMA} & Classifier to filter out low-quality and un-Wikipedia-like text \\
