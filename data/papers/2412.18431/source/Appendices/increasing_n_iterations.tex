Figure \ref{fig:recall_across_iterations_20_iters} expands upon the analysis shown in Figure \ref{fig:recall_across_iterations} by evaluating retrieval performance over 20 iterations, rather than the initial 4 iterations. The results demonstrate a consistent pattern across all methods: retrieval performance stabilises after approximately 4 iterations, with no substantial improvements or degradation in subsequent iterations. While some minor fluctuations occur beyond this point, they are negligible.

This performance plateau can be attributed to two key factors. First, the query re-writing mechanisms in all investigated approaches struggle to generate effective subsequent queries. Second, our analysis has identified several cases of unanswerable queries within MuSiQue's answerable subset. A representative example is provided in Table~\ref{tab:musique_problematic_example}.

Wayne won his only Academy Award for his performance in this film and reprised his role for the 1975 sequel Rooster Cogburn.}\\
