  "abstract": "Retrieval-augmented generation systems rely on effective document retrieval\ncapabilities. By design, conventional sparse or dense retrievers face\nchallenges in multi-hop retrieval scenarios. In this paper, we present GeAR,\nwhich advances RAG performance through two key innovations: (i) graph\nexpansion, which enhances any conventional base retriever, such as BM25, and\n(ii) an agent framework that incorporates graph expansion. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates GeAR's superior retrieval performance on three multi-hop question\nanswering datasets. Additionally, our system achieves state-of-the-art results\nwith improvements exceeding 10% on the challenging MuSiQue dataset, while\nrequiring fewer tokens and iterations compared to other multi-step retrieval\nsystems.",
