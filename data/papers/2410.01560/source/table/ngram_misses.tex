       How many ordered triplets $(a,b,c)$ of rational numbers are there where $a,b,c$ are the roots of $x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0?$    & Find the number of ordered triplets $(a,b,c)$ of real numbers such that the cubic equation $x^3+ax^2+bx+c=0$ has roots $a$, $b$, and $c$. \\\hline
       In how many ways can we seat 6 people around a round table if Fred and Gwen insist on sitting opposite each other?  (Two seatings are considered equivalent if one is a rotation of the other.)    &  A circular table has 6 identical chairs placed around it. In how many ways can 6 people, including Alice and Bob, be seated around the table if Alice and Bob want to sit opposite each other? Two seating arrangements are considered the same if one is a rotation of the other. \\\bottomrule
