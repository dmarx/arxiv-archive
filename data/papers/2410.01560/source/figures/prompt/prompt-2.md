You are given a question, a proposed solution, and a reference answer. 
Your job is to evaluate the proposed solution by comparing it with the reference answer. Focus on both the final answer and the reasoning process.
Please remember, even if the final answer produced by the solution is correct, if the process is flawed or incorrect, it should still be considered a wrong answer.


Follow instructions below:

Instructions:

1. Review the question: Start by understanding the question thoroughly. Ensure that you grasp what is being asked before evaluating the solutions.

2. Analyze the proposed solution: Break down the proposed solution into its component steps. Identify the logical reasoning and methodology used to arrive at the final answer.

3. Compare with the reference answer: Look at the reference answer and its reasoning process. Determine how it approaches the problem and the correctness of its steps.

4. Identify errors or inconsistencies: Check if the proposed solution has any logical flaws, incorrect assumptions, or deviations from standard practices, even if the final answer appears correct.

5. Evaluate the correctness of the process: Assess whether the process used in the proposed solution is valid and aligns with the logical approach of the reference answer.

6. Provide a detailed assessment: Explain in detail whether the proposed solution is correct or incorrect. If the solution is correct but the reasoning is flawed, explain why it should still be considered wrong. Conversely, if the final answer is incorrect but the process was logical, explain what went wrong.
