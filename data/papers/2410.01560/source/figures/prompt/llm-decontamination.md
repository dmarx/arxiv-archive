I will now give you two questions Original question and Candidate question, please help me determine if the following two questions are the same.

Original question: {question}
Candidate question: {candidate}

Disregard the names and minor changes in word order that appear within.
If their question prompts are very similar and, without considering the solution process, they produce the same answer, we consider them to be the same question.
Please respond with only "True" or "False" based on your judgment. Do not respond with anything else.
