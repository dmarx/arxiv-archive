Problem:
Two railway stations are at a distance of 96 km from each other.
One train covers this distance 40 minutes faster than does the other. The speed of the first train is 12 km/h higher than that of the second. Determine the speed of both trains.

Write another problem inspired by this one:
A student was asked to multiply 78 by a two-digit number
in which the tens digit was three times as large as the units digit; by mistake, he interchanged the digits in the second factor and thus obtained a product smaller than the true product by 2808. What was the true product?
