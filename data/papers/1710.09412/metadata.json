  "abstract": "Large deep neural networks are powerful, but exhibit undesirable behaviors\nsuch as memorization and sensitivity to adversarial examples. In this work, we\npropose mixup, a simple learning principle to alleviate these issues. In\nessence, mixup trains a neural network on convex combinations of pairs of\nexamples and their labels. By doing so, mixup regularizes the neural network to\nfavor simple linear behavior in-between training examples. Our experiments on\nthe ImageNet-2012, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Google commands and UCI datasets show\nthat mixup improves the generalization of state-of-the-art neural network\narchitectures. We also find that mixup reduces the memorization of corrupt\nlabels, increases the robustness to adversarial examples, and stabilizes the\ntraining of generative adversarial networks.",
