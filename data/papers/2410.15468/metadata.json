  "title": "What Emergence Can Possibly Mean",
  "authors": "Sean M. Carroll, Achyuth Parola",
  "abstract": "We consider emergence from the perspective of dynamics: states of a system\nevolving with time. We focus on the role of a decomposition of wholes into\nparts, and attempt to characterize relationships between levels without\nreference to whether higher-level properties are \"novel\" or \"unexpected.\" We\noffer a classification of different varieties of emergence, with and without\nnew ontological elements at higher levels.",
