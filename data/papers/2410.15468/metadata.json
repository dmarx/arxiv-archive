  "title": "What Emergence Can Possibly Mean",
  "authors": "Sean M. Carroll, Achyuth Parola",
  "abstract": "We consider emergence from the perspective of dynamics: states of a system evolving with time. We focus on the role of a decomposition of wholes into parts, and attempt to characterize relationships between levels without reference to whether higher-level properties are \"novel\" or \"unexpected.\" We offer a classification of different varieties of emergence, with and without new ontological elements at higher levels.",
