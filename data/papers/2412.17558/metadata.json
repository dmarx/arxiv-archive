  "authors": "Mingyang Song, Mao Zheng",
  "abstract": "\\textit{Query Optimization} (QO) refers to techniques aimed at enhancing the\nefficiency and quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and\nanswering queries, especially complex ones in scenarios like\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, RAG mitigates the\nlimitations of LLMs by dynamically retrieving and leveraging up-to-date\nrelevant information, which provides a cost-effective solution to the challenge\nof LLMs producing plausible but potentially inaccurate responses. Recently, as\nRAG evolves and incorporates multiple components that influence its\nperformance, QO has emerged as a critical element, playing a pivotal role in\ndetermining the effectiveness of RAG's retrieval stage in accurately sourcing\nthe necessary multiple pieces of evidence to answer queries correctly. In this\npaper, we trace the evolution of QO techniques by summarizing and analyzing\nsignificant studies. Through an organized framework and categorization, we aim\nto consolidate existing QO techniques in RAG, elucidate their technological\nfoundations, and highlight their potential to enhance the versatility and\napplications of LLMs.",
