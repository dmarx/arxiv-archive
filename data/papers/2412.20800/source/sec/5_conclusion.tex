In this paper, we present VMix, which uses the disentangled aesthetic description as an additional condition and employs a cross-attention control method to enhance the performance of model across various aesthetic dimensions. We discover one of the most crucial factors for aligning the model with human expectations is training with decoupled, fine-grained aesthetic labels using a suitable conditional control method. Inspired by these, we proposed an effective conditional control method that significantly improves the generative quality of the model. Extensive experiments validate that VMix surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in terms of text fidelity and visual aesthetics. As a plug-and-play plugin, VMix can seamlessly integrate with open-source models, enhancing aesthetic performance and thereby further promoting the development of the community.
