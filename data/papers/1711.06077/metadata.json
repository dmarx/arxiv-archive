  "abstract": "Image restoration algorithms are typically evaluated by some distortion\nmeasure (e.g. PSNR, SSIM, IFC, VIF) or by human opinion scores that quantify\nperceived perceptual quality. In this paper, we prove mathematically that\ndistortion and perceptual quality are at odds with each other. Specifically, we\nstudy the optimal probability for correctly discriminating the outputs of an\nimage restoration algorithm from real images. We show that as the mean\ndistortion decreases, this probability must increase (indicating worse\nperceptual quality). As opposed to the common belief, this result holds true\nfor any distortion measure, and is not only a problem of the PSNR or SSIM\ncriteria. We also show that generative-adversarial-nets (GANs) provide a\nprincipled way to approach the perception-distortion bound. This constitutes\ntheoretical support to their observed success in low-level vision tasks. Based\non our analysis, we propose a new methodology for evaluating image restoration\nmethods, and use it to perform an extensive comparison between recent\nsuper-resolution algorithms.",
