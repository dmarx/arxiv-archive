  "abstract": "The poor performance of transformers on arithmetic tasks seems to stem in\nlarge part from their inability to keep track of the exact position of each\ndigit inside of a large span of digits. We mend this problem by adding an\nembedding to each digit that encodes its position relative to the start of the\nnumber. In addition to the boost these embeddings provide on their own, we show\nthat this fix enables architectural modifications such as input injection and\nrecurrent layers to improve performance even further.\n  With positions resolved, we can study the logical extrapolation ability of\ntransformers. Can they solve arithmetic problems that are larger and more\ncomplex than those in their training data? We find that training on only 20\ndigit numbers with a single GPU for one day, we can reach state-of-the-art\nperformance, achieving up to 99% accuracy on 100 digit addition problems.\nFinally, we show that these gains in numeracy also unlock improvements on other\nmulti-step reasoning tasks including sorting and multiplication.",
