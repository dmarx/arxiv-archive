  "title": "Deep Neural Tangent Kernel and Laplace Kernel Have the Same RKHS",
  "authors": "Lin Chen, Sheng Xu",
  "abstract": "We prove that the reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) of a deep neural\ntangent kernel and the Laplace kernel include the same set of functions, when\nboth kernels are restricted to the sphere $\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$. Additionally, we\nprove that the exponential power kernel with a smaller power (making the kernel\nless smooth) leads to a larger RKHS, when it is restricted to the sphere\n$\\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ and when it is defined on the entire $\\mathbb{R}^d$.",
