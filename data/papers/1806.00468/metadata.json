  "title": "Implicit Bias of Gradient Descent on Linear Convolutional Networks",
  "authors": "Suriya Gunasekar, Jason Lee, Daniel Soudry, Nathan Srebro",
  "abstract": "We show that gradient descent on full-width linear convolutional networks of\ndepth $L$ converges to a linear predictor related to the $\\ell_{2/L}$ bridge\npenalty in the frequency domain. This is in contrast to linearly fully\nconnected networks, where gradient descent converges to the hard margin linear\nsupport vector machine solution, regardless of depth.",
