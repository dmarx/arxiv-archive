  "abstract": "Neural embeddings have been used with great success in Natural Language\nProcessing (NLP). They provide compact representations that encapsulate word\nsimilarity and attain state-of-the-art performance in a range of linguistic\ntasks. The success of neural embeddings has prompted significant amounts of\nresearch into applications in domains other than language. One such domain is\ngraph-structured data, where embeddings of vertices can be learned that\nencapsulate vertex similarity and improve performance on tasks including edge\nprediction and vertex labelling. For both NLP and graph based tasks, embeddings\nhave been learned in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. However, recent work\nhas shown that the appropriate isometric space for embedding complex networks\nis not the flat Euclidean space, but negatively curved, hyperbolic space. We\npresent a new concept that exploits these recent insights and propose learning\nneural embeddings of graphs in hyperbolic space. We provide experimental\nevidence that embedding graphs in their natural geometry significantly improves\nperformance on downstream tasks for several real-world public datasets.",
