  "abstract": "We present Deep Compression Autoencoder (DC-AE), a new family of autoencoder\nmodels for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoder\nmodels have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression\nratio (e.g., 8x), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for\nhigh spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by\nintroducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our\nmodels to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to\nalleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;\n(2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases\ntraining strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high\nspatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the\nautoencoder's spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the\nreconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we\nachieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet\n512x512, our DC-AE provides 19.1x inference speedup and 17.9x training speedup\non H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely\nused SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.
