  We present Deep Compression Autoencoder(DC-AE), a new family of autoencoders for accelerating high-resolution diffusion models. Existing autoencoders have demonstrated impressive results at a moderate spatial compression ratio (e.g., 8$\times$), but fail to maintain satisfactory reconstruction accuracy for high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64$\times$). We address this challenge by introducing two key techniques: (1) **Residual Autoencoding**, where we design our models to learn residuals based on the space-to-channel transformed features to alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders; (2) **Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation**, an efficient decoupled three-phase training strategy for mitigating the generalization penalty of high spatial-compression autoencoders. With these designs, we improve the autoencoderâ€™s spatial compression ratio up to 128 while maintaining the reconstruction quality. Applying our DC-AE to latent diffusion models, we achieve significant speedup without accuracy drop. For example, on ImageNet $512 \times 512$, our DC-AE provides **19.1$\times$** inference speedup and **17.9$\times$** training speedup on H100 GPU for UViT-H while achieving a better FID, compared with the widely used SD-VAE-f8 autoencoder.
