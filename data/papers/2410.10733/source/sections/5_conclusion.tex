We accelerate high-resolution diffusion models by designing deep compression autoencoders to reduce the number of tokens. We proposed two techniques: \textit{residual autoencoding} and \textit{decoupled high-resolution adaptation} to address the challenges brought by the high compression ratio. The resulting new autoencoder family \modelshort demonstrated satisfactory reconstruction accuracy with a spatial compression ratio of up to 128. \modelshort also demonstrated significant training and inference efficiency improvements when applied to latent diffusion models.
