\section{Diffusion Model Architecture Details}
In addition to existing UViT models, we scaled the model up to 1.6B parameters, with a depth of 28, a hidden dimension of 2048, and 32 heads. We denote this model as UViT-2B.

\section{High-Resolution Image Generation Results}

\input{tables/diffusion_hr_main}
Apart from ImageNet 512$\times$512, we also test our models for higher-resolution image generation. As shown in Table~\ref{tab:diffusion_hr_main}, we have a similar finding where \modelshort-f32p1 achieves better FID than SD-VAE-f8p2 for all cases.
