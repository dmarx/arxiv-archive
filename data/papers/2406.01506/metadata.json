  "abstract": "The linear representation hypothesis is the informal idea that semantic\nconcepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise\nfor representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., {male,\nfemale}) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts\ndo not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In\nthis work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation\nhypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as vectors. This allows us\nto immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as\npolytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to\nprove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the\ngeometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the\nGemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+\nhierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.",
