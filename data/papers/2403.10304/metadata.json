  "abstract": "We present a Wikidata-based framework, called KIF, for virtually integrating\nheterogeneous knowledge sources. KIF is written in Python and is released as\nopen-source. It leverages Wikidata's data model and vocabulary plus\nuser-defined mappings to construct a unified view of the underlying sources\nwhile keeping track of the context and provenance of their statements. The\nunderlying sources can be triplestores, relational databases, CSV files, etc.,\nwhich may or may not use the vocabulary and RDF encoding of Wikidata. The end\nresult is a virtual knowledge base which behaves like an \"extended Wikidata\"\nand which can be queried using a simple but expressive pattern language,\ndefined in terms of Wikidata's data model. In this paper, we present the design\nand implementation of KIF, discuss how we have used it to solve a real\nintegration problem in the domain of chemistry (involving Wikidata, PubChem,\nand IBM CIRCA), and present experimental results on the performance and\noverhead of KIF",
