  "abstract": "Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful tool for video\nobject segmentation and tracking anything. Key components of SAM 2 that drive\nthe impressive video object segmentation performance include a large multistage\nimage encoder for frame feature extraction and a memory mechanism that stores\nmemory contexts from past frames to help current frame segmentation. The high\ncomputation complexity of multistage image encoder and memory module has\nlimited its applications in real-world tasks, e.g., video object segmentation\non mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientTAMs,\nlightweight track anything models that produce high-quality results with low\nlatency and model size. Our idea is based on revisiting the plain,\nnonhierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder for video object\nsegmentation, and introducing an efficient memory module, which reduces the\ncomplexity for both frame feature extraction and memory computation for current\nframe segmentation. We take vanilla lightweight ViTs and efficient memory\nmodule to build EfficientTAMs, and train the models on SA-1B and SA-V datasets\nfor video object segmentation and track anything tasks. We evaluate on multiple\nvideo segmentation benchmarks including semi-supervised VOS and promptable\nvideo segmentation, and find that our proposed EfficientTAM with vanilla ViT\nperform comparably to SAM 2 model (HieraB+SAM 2) with ~2x speedup on A100 and\n~2.4x parameter reduction. On segment anything image tasks, our EfficientTAMs\nalso perform favorably over original SAM with ~20x speedup on A100 and ~20x\nparameter reduction. On mobile devices such as iPhone 15 Pro Max, our\nEfficientTAMs can run at ~10 FPS for performing video object segmentation with\nreasonable quality, highlighting the capability of small models for on-device\nvideo object segmentation applications.",
