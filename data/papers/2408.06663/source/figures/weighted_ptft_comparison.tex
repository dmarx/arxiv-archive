  \caption{Amount of performance increase brought by fine-tuning between tasks that model can solve in pre-training (\textcolor{snslightorange}{\textbf{mandarin orange}}) and tasks that the model could not solve until fine-tuning (\textcolor{snsgreen}{\textbf{sage green}}). The exact number of mean increase is shown in Appendix~\ref{sec:app:performance-numbers}.}
