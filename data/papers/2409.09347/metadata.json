  "abstract": "Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby one\nwants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative\nmodeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising\nDiffusion Models (DDMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport\nproblems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However,\nthese methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known\nto have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for\nhigh-dimensional data-rich problems, such as DDM-based Rectified Flow and\nSchr\\\"odinger Bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at\neach iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant\nerrors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge, a\ndynamic entropy-regularised version of OT, that eliminates the need to train\nmultiple DDM-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretisation of a\nflow of path measures, which we call the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge Flow, whose only\nstationary point is the Schr\\\"odinger Bridge. We demonstrate the performance of\nour algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.",
