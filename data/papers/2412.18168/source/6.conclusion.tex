\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we creatively apply the concept of multiple ordinal classification to highlight the inherent gap between pairwise methods and the ideal CF. Based on this theory, we introduce an innovative pseudo-ranking paradigm (PRP). Our implementation features a novel ranker that generates pseudo-rankings, supervised by a noise mechanism. We also propose a new loss function to handle ranking information effectively. Furthermore, this loss is enhanced with a gradient-based confidence mechanism that mitigates abnormal rankings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. This work marks a significant advancement in CF modeling, shifting the focus from pairwise comparisons to a more comprehensive ranking approach, and represents a major step toward realizing ideal CF models.
