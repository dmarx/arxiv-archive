  abstract: "Hyperbolicity is a property of a graph that may be viewed as being a\
    \ \"soft\"\nversion of a tree, and recent empirical and theoretical work has suggested\
    \ that\nmany graphs arising in Internet and related data applications have hyperbolic\n\
    properties. We consider Gromov's notion of \\delta-hyperbolicity, and establish\n\
    several results for small-world and tree-like random graph models. First, we\n\
    study the hyperbolicity of Kleinberg small-world random graphs and show that\n\
    the hyperbolicity of these random graphs is not significantly improved\ncomparing\
    \ to graph diameter even when it greatly improves decentralized\nnavigation. Next\
    \ we study a class of tree-like graphs called ringed trees that\nhave constant\
    \ hyperbolicity. We show that adding random links among the leaves\nsimilar to\
    \ the small-world graph constructions may easily destroy the\nhyperbolicity of\
    \ the graphs, except for a class of random edges added using an\nexponentially\
    \ decaying probability function based on the ring distance among\nthe leaves.\n\
    \  Our study provides one of the first significant analytical results on the\n\
    hyperbolicity of a rich class of random graphs, which shed light on the\nrelationship\

  abstract: 'For many machine learning problem settings, particularly with structured

    inputs such as sequences or sets of objects, a distance measure between inputs

    can be specified more naturally than a feature representation. However, most

    standard machine models are designed for inputs with a vector feature

    representation. In this work, we consider the estimation of a function

    $f:\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \R$ based solely on a dissimilarity measure

    $d:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \R$ between inputs. In particular,

    we propose a general framework to derive a family of \emph{positive definite

    kernels} from a given dissimilarity measure, which subsumes the widely-used

    \emph{representative-set method} as a special case, and relates to the

    well-known \emph{distance substitution kernel} in a limiting case. We show that

    functions in the corresponding Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) are

    Lipschitz-continuous w.r.t. the given distance metric. We provide a tractable

    algorithm to estimate a function from this RKHS, and show that it enjoys better

    generalizability than Nearest-Neighbor estimates. Our approach draws from the

    literature of Random Features, but instead of deriving feature maps from an

    existing kernel, we construct novel kernels from a random feature map, that we

    specify given the distance measure. We conduct classification experiments with

    such disparate domains as strings, time series, and sets of vectors, where our

    proposed framework compares favorably to existing distance-based learning

    methods such as $k$-nearest-neighbors, distance-substitution kernels,

    pseudo-Euclidean embedding, and the representative-set method.'

  abstract: 'This book develops an effective theory approach to understanding deep
    neural

    networks of practical relevance. Beginning from a first-principles

    component-level picture of networks, we explain how to determine an accurate

    description of the output of trained networks by solving layer-to-layer

    iteration equations and nonlinear learning dynamics. A main result is that the

    predictions of networks are described by nearly-Gaussian distributions, with

    the depth-to-width aspect ratio of the network controlling the deviations from

    the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep

    networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly

    analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a

    nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models''

    predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple

    and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of

    representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals

    through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical

    solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain

    how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks

    built from different activation functions into universality classes.

    Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model

    complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic

    techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network

    to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to

    push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail

    about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.'

  abstract: 'We present a scalable method to build a high quality instruction following

    language model by automatically labelling human-written text with corresponding

    instructions. Our approach, named instruction backtranslation, starts with a

    language model finetuned on a small amount of seed data, and a given web

    corpus. The seed model is used to construct training examples by generating

    instruction prompts for web documents (self-augmentation), and then selecting

    high quality examples from among these candidates (self-curation). This data is

    then used to finetune a stronger model. Finetuning LLaMa on two iterations of

    our approach yields a model that outperforms all other LLaMa-based models on

    the Alpaca leaderboard not relying on distillation data, demonstrating highly

  abstract: 'The linear representation hypothesis is the informal idea that semantic

    concepts are encoded as linear directions in the representation spaces of large

    language models (LLMs). Previous work has shown how to make this notion precise

    for representing binary concepts that have natural contrasts (e.g., {male,

    female}) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts

    do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In

    this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation

    hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as vectors. This allows us

    to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as

    polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to

    prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the

    geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the

  abstract: 'Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically

    improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often

    limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. Here, we explore

    inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of

    generated samples. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage
    -

    the fraction of problems solved by any attempt - scales with the number of

    samples over four orders of magnitude. In domains like coding and formal

    proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified, these increases in

    coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated

    sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with

    DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250

    samples, outperforming the single-attempt state-of-the-art of 43% which uses

    more capable frontier models. Moreover, using current API pricing, amplifying

    the cheaper DeepSeek model with five samples is more cost-effective and solves

    more issues than paying a premium for one sample from GPT-4o or Claude 3.5

    Sonnet. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of

    samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power

    law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Finally, we find

    that identifying correct samples out of many generations remains an important

    direction for future research in domains without automatic verifiers. When

    solving math word problems from GSM8K and MATH, coverage with Llama-3 models

    grows to over 95% with 10,000 samples. However, common methods to pick correct

    solutions from a sample collection, such as majority voting or reward models,

    plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample

  abstract: 'Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation
    is

    a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can

    operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of

    inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if

    an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time

    compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?

    Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance

    of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff

    inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little

    research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time

    inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for

    a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms

    to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based

    verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model''s distribution over a

    response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,

    the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute

    critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation

    motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most

    effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this

    compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute

    scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a

    FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model

    attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to

    outperform a 14x larger model.'

  abstract: 'Audio restoration has become increasingly significant in modern society,
    not

    only due to the demand for high-quality auditory experiences enabled by

    advanced playback devices, but also because the growing capabilities of

    generative audio models necessitate high-fidelity audio. Typically, audio

    restoration is defined as a task of predicting undistorted audio from damaged

    input, often trained using a GAN framework to balance perception and

    distortion. Since audio degradation is primarily concentrated in mid- and

    high-frequency ranges, especially due to codecs, a key challenge lies in

    designing a generator capable of preserving low-frequency information while

    accurately reconstructing high-quality mid- and high-frequency content.

    Inspired by recent advancements in high-sample-rate music separation, speech

    enhancement, and audio codec models, we propose Apollo, a generative model

    designed for high-sample-rate audio restoration. Apollo employs an explicit

    frequency band split module to model the relationships between different

  abstract: 'Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes
    or an

    inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed

    cheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this

    hierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [Zeng et al.,

    2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of

    Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al.,

    2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in

    modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure:

    a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label

    hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a

    simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based

    representation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any

    standard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments

    on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of

    HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance

    especially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of

    structured representation, we perform eigenvalue analysis that links the

    representation geometry to improved Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection

    performance seen empirically. The code is available at

  abstract: 'In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods

    stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning

    rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by

    their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning

    rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent

    training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer''s

    memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency,

    SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of

    Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of

    using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K

    classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large

    hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further

    tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion

    models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a

    memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for

    the

    efficiency and quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and

    of LLMs producing plausible but potentially inaccurate responses. Recently, as

    performance, QO has emerged as a critical element, playing a pivotal role in

    determining the effectiveness of RAG''s retrieval stage in accurately sourcing

    the necessary multiple pieces of evidence to answer queries correctly. In this

    significant studies. Through an organized framework and categorization, we aim

    to consolidate existing QO techniques in RAG, elucidate their technological

  abstract: 'The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems,
    as the

    success of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into

    popular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language

    processing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for

    recommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods

    typically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting,

    which we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1)

    semantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items

    contribute most of the positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the

    cold-start problem that hinders the recommender quality on cold-start items. We

    propose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as

    prompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We

    experimentally prove that compared to the content description proposed in

    existing works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt

    information by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise

    personalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model

    bias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four

  abstract: 'Intuitively, an ideal collaborative filtering (CF) model should learn
    from

    users'' full rankings over all items to make optimal top-K recommendations. Due

    to the absence of such full rankings in practice, most CF models rely on

    pairwise loss functions to approximate full rankings, resulting in an immense

    performance gap. In this paper, we provide a novel analysis using the multiple

    ordinal classification concept to reveal the inevitable gap between a pairwise

    approximation and the ideal case. However, bridging the gap in practice

    encounters two formidable challenges: (1) none of the real-world datasets

    contains full ranking information; (2) there does not exist a loss function

    that is capable of consuming ranking information. To overcome these challenges,

    we propose a pseudo-ranking paradigm (PRP) that addresses the lack of ranking

    information by introducing pseudo-rankings supervised by an original noise

    injection mechanism. Additionally, we put forward a new ranking loss function

    designed to handle ranking information effectively. To ensure our method''s

    robustness against potential inaccuracies in pseudo-rankings, we equip the

    ranking loss function with a gradient-based confidence mechanism to detect and

    mitigate abnormal gradients. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets

    significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and

    a

    comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration,

    categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level

    optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget

    allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while

    model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention

    mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory

    management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across

    diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview

    of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these
