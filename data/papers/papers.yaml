    properties. We consider Gromov's notion of \\delta-hyperbolicity, and establish\n\
    several results for small-world and tree-like random graph models. First, we\n\
    study the hyperbolicity of Kleinberg small-world random graphs and show that\n\
    the hyperbolicity of these random graphs is not significantly improved\ncomparing\
    \ to graph diameter even when it greatly improves decentralized\nnavigation. Next\
    \ we study a class of tree-like graphs called ringed trees that\nhave constant\
    \ hyperbolicity. We show that adding random links among the leaves\nsimilar to\
    \ the small-world graph constructions may easily destroy the\nhyperbolicity of\
    \ the graphs, except for a class of random edges added using an\nexponentially\
    \ decaying probability function based on the ring distance among\nthe leaves.\n\
    \  Our study provides one of the first significant analytical results on the\n\
    hyperbolicity of a rich class of random graphs, which shed light on the\nrelationship\

  abstract: 'Many deep neural networks trained on natural images exhibit a curious

    phenomenon in common: on the first layer they learn features similar to Gabor

    filters and color blobs. Such first-layer features appear not to be specific to

    a particular dataset or task, but general in that they are applicable to many

    datasets and tasks. Features must eventually transition from general to

    specific by the last layer of the network, but this transition has not been

    studied extensively. In this paper we experimentally quantify the generality

    versus specificity of neurons in each layer of a deep convolutional neural

    network and report a few surprising results. Transferability is negatively

    affected by two distinct issues: (1) the specialization of higher layer neurons

    to their original task at the expense of performance on the target task, which

    was expected, and (2) optimization difficulties related to splitting networks

    between co-adapted neurons, which was not expected. In an example network

    trained on ImageNet, we demonstrate that either of these two issues may

    dominate, depending on whether features are transferred from the bottom,

    middle, or top of the network. We also document that the transferability of

    features decreases as the distance between the base task and target task

    increases, but that transferring features even from distant tasks can be better

    than using random features. A final surprising result is that initializing a

    network with transferred features from almost any number of layers can produce

    a boost to generalization that lingers even after fine-tuning to the target

    dataset.'

  abstract: 'A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning

    algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to

    average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole

    ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to

    allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual

    models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it

    is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which

    is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different

    compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show

    that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used

    commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a

    single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more

    full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained

    classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these

    specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.'

    accelerated by the development of better tools for visualizing and interpreting

    neural nets. We introduce two such tools here. The first is a tool that

    visualizes the activations produced on each layer of a trained convnet as it

    processes an image or video (e.g. a live webcam stream). We have found that

    looking at live activations that change in response to user input helps build

  abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words
    of

    the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in

    hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of

    the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape

    (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to

    minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or

    time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast

    that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different

    piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways

    to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a

    "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how

    much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years

    have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of

    approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to

    data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly

    used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture

    processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine

  abstract: 'Hyperbolic embeddings offer excellent quality with few dimensions when

    embedding hierarchical data structures like synonym or type hierarchies. Given

    a tree, we give a combinatorial construction that embeds the tree in hyperbolic

    space with arbitrarily low distortion without using optimization. On WordNet,

    our combinatorial embedding obtains a mean-average-precision of 0.989 with only

    two dimensions, while Nickel et al.''s recent construction obtains 0.87 using

    200 dimensions. We provide upper and lower bounds that allow us to characterize

    the precision-dimensionality tradeoff inherent in any hyperbolic embedding. To

    embed general metric spaces, we propose a hyperbolic generalization of

    multidimensional scaling (h-MDS). We show how to perform exact recovery of

    hyperbolic points from distances, provide a perturbation analysis, and give a

    recovery result that allows us to reduce dimensionality. The h-MDS approach

    offers consistently low distortion even with few dimensions across several

    datasets. Finally, we extract lessons from the algorithms and theory above to

    design a PyTorch-based implementation that can handle incomplete information

  abstract: 'Many recently trained neural networks employ large numbers of parameters
    to

    achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters

    required as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are

    such notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt

    to answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter

    space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase

    the dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear,

    and define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The

    approach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces

    several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions

    than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies

    little across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter

    result has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough

    to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the

    dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some

    quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement,

    and other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the

    inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from

    MNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying

    CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes

    wandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for

    constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a

    solution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing

    networks, in some cases by more than 100 times.'

    bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also

    perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations

    for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn

    distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically

    well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep

    ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible

    explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable

    variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep

    ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this

    hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of

    neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of

    functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random

    initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an

    optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a

    single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight

    space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that

    the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular

    ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and

  abstract: 'A basic operation in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is spatial
    resizing

    of feature maps. This is done either by strided convolution (donwscaling) or

    transposed convolution (upscaling). Such operations are limited to a fixed

    filter moving at predetermined integer steps (strides). Spatial sizes of

    consecutive layers are related by integer scale factors, predetermined at

    architectural design, and remain fixed throughout training and inference time.

    We propose a generalization of the common Conv-layer, from a discrete layer to

    a Continuous Convolution (CC) Layer. CC Layers naturally extend Conv-layers by

    representing the filter as a learned continuous function over sub-pixel

    coordinates. This allows learnable and principled resizing of feature maps, to

    any size, dynamically and consistently across scales. Once trained, the CC

    layer can be used to output any scale/size chosen at inference time. The scale

    can be non-integer and differ between the axes. CC gives rise to new freedoms

    for architectural design, such as dynamic layer shapes at inference time, or

    gradual architectures where the size changes by a small factor at each layer.

    This gives rise to many desired CNN properties, new architectural design

    capabilities, and useful applications. We further show that current Conv-layers

    suffer from inherent misalignments, which are ameliorated by CC layers.'

  abstract: 'Although pretrained language models can be fine-tuned to produce

    state-of-the-art results for a very wide range of language understanding tasks,

    the dynamics of this process are not well understood, especially in the low

    data regime. Why can we use relatively vanilla gradient descent algorithms

    (e.g., without strong regularization) to tune a model with hundreds of millions

    of parameters on datasets with only hundreds or thousands of labeled examples?

    In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of

    intrinsic dimension provides us with empirical and theoretical intuitions to

    explain this remarkable phenomenon. We empirically show that common pre-trained

    models have a very low intrinsic dimension; in other words, there exists a low

    dimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full

    parameter space. For example, by optimizing only 200 trainable parameters

    randomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to

    achieve 90\% of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we

    empirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension

    and, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension

    after a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their

    extreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low

    dimensional task representations and compression based generalization bounds to

    provide intrinsic-dimension-based generalization bounds that are independent of

    the full parameter count.'

    each task. Recent work has developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,

    Compacter, a method for fine-tuning large-scale language models with a better

    prior work. Compacter accomplishes this by building on top of ideas from

    adapters, low-rank optimization, and parameterized hypercomplex multiplication

    pretrained model''s weights, which are computed efficiently as a sum of

    Kronecker products between shared "slow" weights and "fast" rank-one matrices

    defined per Compacter layer. By only training 0.047% of a pretrained model''s

    the infinite-width Gaussian description. We explain how these effectively-deep

    networks learn nontrivial representations from training and more broadly

    analyze the mechanism of representation learning for nonlinear models. From a

    nearly-kernel-methods perspective, we find that the dependence of such models''

    predictions on the underlying learning algorithm can be expressed in a simple

    and universal way. To obtain these results, we develop the notion of

    representation group flow (RG flow) to characterize the propagation of signals

    through the network. By tuning networks to criticality, we give a practical

    solution to the exploding and vanishing gradient problem. We further explain

    how RG flow leads to near-universal behavior and lets us categorize networks

    built from different activation functions into universality classes.

    Altogether, we show that the depth-to-width ratio governs the effective model

    complexity of the ensemble of trained networks. By using information-theoretic

    techniques, we estimate the optimal aspect ratio at which we expect the network

    to be practically most useful and show how residual connections can be used to

    push this scale to arbitrary depths. With these tools, we can learn in detail

    about the inductive bias of architectures, hyperparameters, and optimizers.'

  abstract: 'Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to
    train

    and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory

    requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g.,

    sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread

    adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality

    tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable

    algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues,

    we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are

    parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware

    utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms).

    Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch

    matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties

    of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense

    models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable

    accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training

    applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and

    Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and

    reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In

    sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called "reverse

    sparsification," Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation

    to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The

    same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized

    implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse

    fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds

    up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.'

  abstract: 'At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are
    not

    well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that

    training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to

    gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple

    weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced

    by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on
    a

    regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when

    training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the

    models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the

    weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained

    Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in

    their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression

    problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context

    learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore

    identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by

    learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data

    representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss

    intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context

    learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be

    understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent

    learning within Transformers. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at

    the neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data,

    claiming that they can make personal data "unexploitable." This paper provides

    a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable

    data might only be an illusion. In particular, we leverage the power of

    diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can

    counteract the effectiveness of the data-protecting perturbations. We

    rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of

    required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting

    perturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-of-the-art

    performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various

    scenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch

    between the diffusion model and the protected data. Our findings call for more

    introduce SpaceTime, a new state-space time series architecture that improves

    all three criteria. For expressivity, we propose a new SSM parameterization

    based on the companion matrix -- a canonical representation for discrete-time

    processes -- which enables SpaceTime''s SSM layers to learn desirable

    autoregressive processes. For long horizon forecasting, we introduce a

    "closed-loop" variation of the companion SSM, which enables SpaceTime to

    predict many future time-steps by generating its own layer-wise inputs. For

    efficient training and inference, we introduce an algorithm that reduces the

    memory and compute of a forward pass with the companion matrix. With sequence

    length $\ell$ and state-space size $d$, we go from $\tilde{O}(d \ell)$

    na\"ively to $\tilde{O}(d + \ell)$. In experiments, our contributions lead to

    state-of-the-art results on extensive and diverse benchmarks, with best or

    second-best AUROC on 6 / 7 ECG and speech time series classification, and best

    MSE on 14 / 16 Informer forecasting tasks. Furthermore, we find SpaceTime (1)

    fits AR($p$) processes that prior deep SSMs fail on, (2) forecasts notably more

    accurately on longer horizons than prior state-of-the-art, and (3) speeds up

    training on real-world ETTh1 data by 73% and 80% relative wall-clock time over

    Transformers and LSTMs.'

  abstract: 'Inversion by Direct Iteration (InDI) is a new formulation for supervised

    image restoration that avoids the so-called "regression to the mean" effect and

    produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based

    methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps,

    similar to generative denoising diffusion models. Image restoration is an

    ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images are plausible

    reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the outcome of a

    single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all possible

    explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main advantage of InDI

    is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in a single step but

    instead gradually improves the image in small steps, resulting in better

    perceptual quality. While generative denoising diffusion models also work in

    small steps, our formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge

    of any analytic form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an

    iterative restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired

    examples. InDI can be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired

    training data. In conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the

    denoising network generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an

    initial image of pure noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to

    conditional denoising formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively

    restoring the input low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a

    variety of image restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus

    deblurring, super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising.'

  abstract: 'Recent work claims that large language models display emergent abilities,

    abilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale

    models. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness,

    transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their

    unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we

    present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a

    particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent

    abilities appear due to the researcher''s choice of metric rather than due to

    fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or

    discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or

    continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model

    performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical

    model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm

    three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3

    family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two

    predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on

    BIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen

    seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep

    networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent

    abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may

    not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.'

  abstract: 'Pretraining is the preliminary and fundamental step in developing capable

    language models (LM). Despite this, pretraining data design is critically

    under-documented and often guided by empirically unsupported intuitions. To

    address this, we pretrain 28 1.5B parameter decoder-only models, training on

    data curated (1) at different times, (2) with varying toxicity and quality

    filters, and (3) with different domain compositions. First, we quantify the

    effect of pretraining data age. A temporal shift between evaluation data and

    pretraining data leads to performance degradation, which is not overcome by

    finetuning. Second, we explore the effect of quality and toxicity filters,

    showing a trade-off between performance on standard benchmarks and risk of

    toxic generations. Our findings indicate there does not exist a

    one-size-fits-all solution to filtering training data. We also find that the

    effects of different types of filtering are not predictable from text domain

    characteristics. Lastly, we empirically validate that the inclusion of

    heterogeneous data sources, like books and web, is broadly beneficial and

    warrants greater prioritization. These findings constitute the largest set of

    experiments to validate, quantify, and expose many undocumented intuitions

    about text pretraining, which we hope will help support more informed

  abstract: 'Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a leading approach
    for

    generating high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of

    these models exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking that divides the

    generative dynamics into two distinct phases: 1) A linear steady-state dynamics

    around a central fixed-point and 2) an attractor dynamics directed towards the

    data manifold. These two "phases" are separated by the change in stability of

    the central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being

    responsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical

    and empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early

    dynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early

    fluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight,

    we propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves

    model performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while

    also increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA

    images). Our work offers a new way to understand the generative dynamics of

    diffusion models that has the potential to bring about higher performance and

  abstract: 'Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem
    in

    the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling

    and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications

    in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main

    bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase

    quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric

    GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of

    quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\times$ compared to optimized baselines),

    with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as

    optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\% of the

    theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to

    suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the

    GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We

    propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these

    issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of

    non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single

    head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each

    thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through

    shared memory. These yield around 2$\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention,

    reaching 50-73\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close

    to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used

    end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed

    of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\% model FLOPs utilization).'

  abstract: 'Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery

    (CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise

    causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when

    considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not

    provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results

    and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered

    affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output

    uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with

    those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by

    proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief

    distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information

    criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the

    diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to

    iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively

    reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we

    update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.

    Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved

    confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that

    our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and

    that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.'

    writers and implement a human assessment of 48 stories written either by

    professional authors or LLMs using TTCW. Our analysis shows that LLM-generated

  abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters
    have

    sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, they are

    computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to

    reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have

    to forgo LLM''s in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time

    speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are

    small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield

    approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address

    these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be

    accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in

    wall-clock time without compromising LLM''s quality or in-context learning

    ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a

    low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to

    each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that

    speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference

    latency of OPT-175B by over 2X compared to the state-of-the-art

    FasterTransformer, and over 6X compared to the widely used Hugging Face

    implementation, without compromising model quality. The code is available at

    times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art

    quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do

    not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work,

    we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human

    together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes

    only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it

    automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable

    human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize

    the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g.

    cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model.

    Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the

    artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly

    optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of

    individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose

    the generally degraded style fidelity. To address these challenges, we

    introduce StyleCrafter, a generic method that enhances pre-trained T2V models

    with a style control adapter, enabling video generation in any style by

    providing a reference image. Considering the scarcity of stylized video

    datasets, we propose to first train a style control adapter using style-rich

    generation through a tailor-made finetuning paradigm. To promote content-style

    disentanglement, we remove style descriptions from the text prompt and extract

    style information solely from the reference image using a decoupling learning

    strategy. Additionally, we design a scale-adaptive fusion module to balance the

    influences of text-based content features and image-based style features, which

    helps generalization across various text and style combinations. StyleCrafter

    efficiently generates high-quality stylized videos that align with the content

    of the texts and resemble the style of the reference images. Experiments

    demonstrate that our approach is more flexible and efficient than existing

  abstract: 'Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in
    deep

    learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its

    core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear

    attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space

    models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers'' computational

    inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as

    attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key

    weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning,

    and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be

    functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,

    allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the

    sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though

    this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a

    hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these

    selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without

    attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$

    higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and

    its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a

    general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance

    across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language

    modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and

    matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream

  abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically trained in two phases:

    pre-training on large internet-scale datasets, and fine-tuning for downstream

    tasks. Given the higher computational demand of pre-training, it''s intuitive
    to

    assume that fine-tuning adds less new information to the model, and is thus

    more compressible. We explore this assumption by decomposing the weights of

    fine-tuned models into their pre-trained components and an additional delta. We

    introduce a simple method, BitDelta, which successfully quantizes this delta

    down to 1 bit without compromising performance. This interesting finding not

    only highlights the potential redundancy of information added during

    fine-tuning, but also has significant implications for the multi-tenant serving

    and multi-tenant storage of fine-tuned models. By enabling the use of a single

    high-precision base model accompanied by multiple 1-bit deltas, BitDelta

    dramatically reduces GPU memory requirements by more than 10x, which can also

    be translated to enhanced generation latency in multi-tenant settings. We

    validate BitDelta through experiments across Llama-2 and Mistral model

  abstract: 'Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often

    overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the

    source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on

    byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased

    use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have

    been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit

    tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and

    3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical

    reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and

    right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left

    tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to

    largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using

    standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns,

    suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We

    show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus

    allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on

    left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization

    directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger

    models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias.

    In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization

    choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks,

    accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work

    inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related

    choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning.'

  abstract: 'Over the last 70 years, we, humans, have created an economic market where

    attention is being captured and turned into money thanks to advertising. During

    the last two decades, leveraging research in psychology, sociology,

    neuroscience and other domains, Web platforms have brought the process of

    capturing attention to an unprecedented scale. With the initial commonplace

    goal of making targeted advertising more effective, the generalization of

    attention-capturing techniques and their use of cognitive biases and emotions

    have multiple detrimental side effects such as polarizing opinions, spreading

    false information and threatening public health, economies and democracies.

    This is clearly a case where the Web is not used for the common good and where,

    in fact, all its users become a vulnerable population. This paper brings

    together contributions from a wide range of disciplines to analyze current

    practices and consequences thereof. Through a set of propositions and

    principles that could be used do drive further works, it calls for actions

    against these practices competing to capture our attention on the Web, as it

    would be unsustainable for a civilization to allow attention to be wasted with

    impunity on a world-wide scale.'

  abstract: 'The BigCode project, an open-scientific collaboration focused on the

    responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs),

    introduces StarCoder2. In partnership with Software Heritage (SWH), we build

    The Stack v2 on top of the digital commons of their source code archive.

    Alongside the SWH repositories spanning 619 programming languages, we carefully

    select other high-quality data sources, such as GitHub pull requests, Kaggle

    notebooks, and code documentation. This results in a training set that is 4x

    larger than the first StarCoder dataset. We train StarCoder2 models with 3B,

    7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens and thoroughly evaluate

    them on a comprehensive set of Code LLM benchmarks. We find that our small

    model, StarCoder2-3B, outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size on most

    benchmarks, and also outperforms StarCoderBase-15B. Our large model,

    StarCoder2- 15B, significantly outperforms other models of comparable size. In

    addition, it matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B, a model more than twice its

    size. Although DeepSeekCoder- 33B is the best-performing model at code

    completion for high-resource languages, we find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms

    it on math and code reasoning benchmarks, as well as several low-resource

    languages. We make the model weights available under an OpenRAIL license and

    ensure full transparency regarding the training data by releasing the SoftWare

    Heritage persistent IDentifiers (SWHIDs) of the source code data.'

    we introduce Multimodal ArXiv, consisting of ArXivCap and ArXivQA, for

    enhancing LVLMs scientific comprehension. ArXivCap is a figure-caption dataset

    comprising 6.4M images and 3.9M captions, sourced from 572K ArXiv papers

    spanning various scientific domains. Drawing from ArXivCap, we introduce

    ArXivQA, a question-answering dataset generated by prompting GPT-4V based on

    scientific figures. ArXivQA greatly enhances open-sourced LVLMs'' mathematical

    reasoning capabilities, achieving a 10.4\% absolute accuracy gain on a

    multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, employing ArXivCap,

    we devise four vision-to-text tasks for benchmarking LVLMs. Evaluation results

    with state-of-the-art LVLMs underscore their struggle with the nuanced

    semantics of academic figures, while domain-specific training yields

    substantial performance gains. Our error analysis uncovers misinterpretations

    of visual context, recognition errors, and the production of overly simplified

  abstract: 'Scaling laws are useful guides for derisking expensive training runs,
    as they

    predict performance of large models using cheaper, small-scale experiments.

    However, there remain gaps between current scaling studies and how language

    models are ultimately trained and evaluated. For instance, scaling is usually

    studied in the compute-optimal training regime (i.e., "Chinchilla optimal"

    regime). In contrast, models are often over-trained to reduce inference costs.

    Moreover, scaling laws mostly predict loss on next-token prediction, but models

    are usually compared on downstream task performance. To address both

    shortcomings, we create a testbed of 104 models with 0.011B to 6.9B parameters

    trained with various numbers of tokens on three data distributions. First, we

    fit scaling laws that extrapolate in both the amount of over-training and the

    number of model parameters. This enables us to predict the validation loss of
    a

    1.4B parameter, 900B token run (i.e., 32$\times$ over-trained) and a 6.9B

    parameter, 138B token run (i.e., a compute-optimal run)$\unicode{x2014}$each

    from experiments that take 300$\times$ less compute. Second, we relate the

    perplexity of a language model to its downstream task performance by proposing

    a power law. We use this law to predict top-1 error averaged over downstream

    tasks for the two aforementioned models, using experiments that take 20$\times$

    less compute. Our experiments are available at

    https://github.com/mlfoundations/scaling.'

    techniques. The methodology utilizes the SMPL(Skinned Multi-Person Linear)

    model as the 3D human parametric model to establish a unified representation of

    body shape and pose. This facilitates the accurate capture of intricate human

    geometry and motion characteristics from source videos. Specifically, we

    incorporate rendered depth images, normal maps, and semantic maps obtained from

    SMPL sequences, alongside skeleton-based motion guidance, to enrich the

    conditions to the latent diffusion model with comprehensive 3D shape and

    detailed pose attributes. A multi-layer motion fusion module, integrating

    self-attention mechanisms, is employed to fuse the shape and motion latent

    representations in the spatial domain. By representing the 3D human parametric

    model as the motion guidance, we can perform parametric shape alignment of the

    human body between the reference image and the source video motion.

    Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the

    methodology''s superior ability to generate high-quality human animations that

    accurately capture both pose and shape variations. Furthermore, our approach

  abstract: 'Adversarial examples for diffusion models are widely used as solutions
    for

    safety concerns. By adding adversarial perturbations to personal images,

    attackers can not edit or imitate them easily. However, it is essential to note

    that all these protections target the latent diffusion model (LDMs), the

    adversarial examples for diffusion models in the pixel space (PDMs) are largely

    overlooked. This may mislead us to think that the diffusion models are

    vulnerable to adversarial attacks like most deep models. In this paper, we show

    novel findings that: even though gradient-based white-box attacks can be used

    to attack the LDMs, they fail to attack PDMs. This finding is supported by

    extensive experiments of almost a wide range of attacking methods on various

    PDMs and LDMs with different model structures, which means diffusion models are

    indeed much more robust against adversarial attacks. We also find that PDMs can

    be used as an off-the-shelf purifier to effectively remove the adversarial

    patterns that were generated on LDMs to protect the images, which means that

    most protection methods nowadays, to some extent, cannot protect our images

    from malicious attacks. We hope that our insights will inspire the community to

    rethink the adversarial samples for diffusion models as protection methods and

    move forward to more effective protection. Codes are available in

    into a latent vector, while DeepSeekMoE enables training strong models at an

    economical cost through sparse computation. Compared with DeepSeek 67B,

    DeepSeek-V2 achieves significantly stronger performance, and meanwhile saves

    42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum

    generation throughput to 5.76 times. We pretrain DeepSeek-V2 on a high-quality

    and multi-source corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens, and further perform

    Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fully unlock

    its potential. Evaluation results show that, even with only 21B activated

    parameters, DeepSeek-V2 and its chat versions still achieve top-tier

    performance among open-source models.'

  abstract: 'In the 1990s, the constant error carousel and gating were introduced
    as the

    central ideas of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Since then, LSTMs have

    stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success

    stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs).

    However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable

    self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at

    scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling

    when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques

    from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we

    introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization

    techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM

    with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that

    is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule.

    Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM

    blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential

    gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform

    favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space

    Models, both in performance and scaling.'

  abstract: 'Generative AI models are often used to perform mimicry attacks, where
    a

    pretrained model is fine-tuned on a small sample of images to learn to mimic a

    specific artist of interest. While researchers have introduced multiple

    anti-mimicry protection tools (Mist, Glaze, Anti-Dreambooth), recent evidence

    points to a growing trend of mimicry models using videos as sources of training

    data. This paper presents our experiences exploring techniques to disrupt style

    mimicry on video imagery. We first validate that mimicry attacks can succeed by

    training on individual frames extracted from videos. We show that while

    anti-mimicry tools can offer protection when applied to individual frames, this

    approach is vulnerable to an adaptive countermeasure that removes protection by

    exploiting randomness in optimization results of consecutive (nearly-identical)

    frames. We develop a new, tool-agnostic framework that segments videos into

    short scenes based on frame-level similarity, and use a per-scene optimization

    baseline to remove inter-frame randomization while reducing computational cost.

    We show via both image level metrics and an end-to-end user study that the

    resulting protection restores protection against mimicry (including the

    countermeasure). Finally, we develop another adaptive countermeasure and find

    that it falls short against our framework.'

  abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) are trained on a vast amount of human-written

    data, but data providers often remain uncredited. In response to this issue,

    data valuation (or data attribution), which quantifies the contribution or

    value of each data to the model output, has been discussed as a potential

    solution. Nevertheless, applying existing data valuation methods to recent LLMs

    and their vast training datasets has been largely limited by prohibitive

    compute and memory costs. In this work, we focus on influence functions, a

    popular gradient-based data valuation method, and significantly improve its

    scalability with an efficient gradient projection strategy called LoGra that

    leverages the gradient structure in backpropagation. We then provide a

    theoretical motivation of gradient projection approaches to influence functions

    to promote trust in the data valuation process. Lastly, we lower the barrier to

    implementing data valuation systems by introducing LogIX, a software package

    that can transform existing training code into data valuation code with minimal

    effort. In our data valuation experiments, LoGra achieves competitive accuracy

    against more expensive baselines while showing up to 6,500x improvement in

    throughput and 5x reduction in GPU memory usage when applied to

    Llama3-8B-Instruct and the 1B-token dataset.'

    include copyright-protected content, typically without the content creator''s

    consent. Copyright traps have been proposed to be injected into the original

    content, improving content detectability in newly released LLMs. Traps,

    however, rely on the exact duplication of a unique text sequence, leaving them

    vulnerable to commonly deployed data deduplication techniques. We here propose

    the generation of fuzzy copyright traps, featuring slight modifications across

    duplication. When injected in the fine-tuning data of a 1.3B LLM, we show fuzzy

    trap sequences to be memorized nearly as well as exact duplicates.

    Specifically, the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) ROC AUC only drops from

    0.90 to 0.87 when 4 tokens are replaced across the fuzzy duplicates. We also

    find that selecting replacement positions to minimize the exact overlap between

    fuzzy duplicates leads to similar memorization, while making fuzzy duplicates

    highly unlikely to be removed by any deduplication process. Lastly, we argue

    that the fact that LLMs memorize across fuzzy duplicates challenges the study

    of LLM memorization relying on naturally occurring duplicates. Indeed, we find

    that the commonly used training dataset, The Pile, contains significant amounts

    of fuzzy duplicates. This introduces a previously unexplored confounding factor

    in post-hoc studies of LLM memorization, and questions the effectiveness of

    (exact) data deduplication as a privacy protection technique.'

  abstract: 'Recent AI systems have shown extremely powerful performance, even surpassing

    human performance, on various tasks such as information retrieval, language

    generation, and image generation based on large language models (LLMs). At the

    same time, there are diverse safety risks that can cause the generation of

    malicious contents by circumventing the alignment in LLMs, which are often

    referred to as jailbreaking. However, most of the previous works only focused

    on the text-based jailbreaking in LLMs, and the jailbreaking of the

    text-to-image (T2I) generation system has been relatively overlooked. In this

    paper, we first evaluate the safety of the commercial T2I generation systems,

    such as ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini, on copyright infringement with naive

    prompts. From this empirical study, we find that Copilot and Gemini block only

    12% and 17% of the attacks with naive prompts, respectively, while ChatGPT

    blocks 84% of them. Then, we further propose a stronger automated jailbreaking

    pipeline for T2I generation systems, which produces prompts that bypass their

    safety guards. Our automated jailbreaking framework leverages an LLM optimizer

    to generate prompts to maximize degree of violation from the generated images

    without any weight updates or gradient computation. Surprisingly, our simple

    yet effective approach successfully jailbreaks the ChatGPT with 11.0% block

    rate, making it generate copyrighted contents in 76% of the time. Finally, we

    explore various defense strategies, such as post-generation filtering and

    machine unlearning techniques, but found that they were inadequate, which

    suggests the necessity of stronger defense mechanisms.'

  abstract: "Selecting high-quality data for pre-training is crucial in shaping the\n\
    downstream task performance of language models. A major challenge lies in\nidentifying\
    \ this optimal subset, a problem generally considered intractable,\nthus necessitating\
    \ scalable and effective heuristics. In this work, we propose\na data selection\
    \ method, CoLoR-Filter (Conditional Loss Reduction Filtering),\nwhich leverages\
    \ an empirical Bayes-inspired approach to derive a simple and\ncomputationally\
    \ efficient selection criterion based on the relative loss values\nof two auxiliary\
    \ models.\n  In addition to the modeling rationale, we evaluate CoLoR-Filter empirically\n\
    on two language modeling tasks: (1) selecting data from C4 for domain\nadaptation\
    \ to evaluation on Books and (2) selecting data from C4 for a suite of\ndownstream\
    \ multiple-choice question answering tasks. We demonstrate favorable\nscaling\
    \ both as we subselect more aggressively and using small auxiliary models\nto\

  abstract: 'Artists are increasingly concerned about advancements in image generation

    models that can closely replicate their unique artistic styles. In response,

    several protection tools against style mimicry have been developed that

    incorporate small adversarial perturbations into artworks published online. In

    this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of popular protections -- with

    millions of downloads -- and show they only provide a false sense of security.

    We find that low-effort and "off-the-shelf" techniques, such as image

    upscaling, are sufficient to create robust mimicry methods that significantly

    degrade existing protections. Through a user study, we demonstrate that all

    existing protections can be easily bypassed, leaving artists vulnerable to

    style mimicry. We caution that tools based on adversarial perturbations cannot

    reliably protect artists from the misuse of generative AI, and urge the

    development of alternative non-technological solutions.'

    critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for

    model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility

  abstract: 'This paper presents Diffusion Forcing, a new training paradigm where
    a

    diffusion model is trained to denoise a set of tokens with independent

    per-token noise levels. We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative

    modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or

    several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown

    to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as

    variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion

    models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our

    method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out

    sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training

    horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that

    uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing''s variable-horizon and causal

    architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and

    planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to

    optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of

    tokens drawn from the true joint distribution. Project website:

  abstract: 'The data mixture for large language model pre-training significantly
    impacts

    performance, yet how to determine an effective mixture remains unclear. We

    propose RegMix to automatically identify a high-performing data mixture by

    formulating it as a regression task. RegMix involves training a set of small

    models with diverse data mixtures and fitting a regression model to predict

    their performance given their respective mixtures. With the fitted regression

    model, we simulate the top-ranked mixture and use it to train a large-scale

    model with orders of magnitude more compute. To empirically validate RegMix, we

    train 512 models with 1M parameters for 1B tokens of different mixtures to fit

    the regression model and find the optimal mixture. Using this mixture we train

    a 1B parameter model for 25B tokens (i.e. 1000x larger and 25x longer) which we

    find performs best among 64 candidate 1B parameter models with other mixtures.

    Further, our method demonstrates superior performance compared to human

    selection and achieves results that match or surpass DoReMi, while utilizing

    only 10% of the compute budget. Our experiments also show that (1) Data

    mixtures significantly impact performance with single-task performance

    variations of up to 14.6%; (2) Web corpora rather than data perceived as

    high-quality like Wikipedia have the strongest positive correlation with

    downstream performance; (3) Domains interact in complex ways often

    contradicting common sense, thus automatic approaches like RegMix are needed;

    (4) Data mixture effects transcend scaling laws, and our approach captures the

    complexity by considering all domains together. Our code is available at

  abstract: 'Robust and effective scaling of models from small to large width typically

    requires the precise adjustment of many algorithmic and architectural details,

    such as parameterization and optimizer choices. In this work, we propose a new

    perspective on parameterization by investigating a key assumption in prior work

    about the alignment between parameters and data and derive new theoretical

    results under weaker assumptions and a broader set of optimizers. Our extensive

    empirical investigation includes tens of thousands of models trained with all

    combinations of three optimizers, four parameterizations, several alignment

    assumptions, more than a dozen learning rates, and fourteen model sizes up to

    26.8B parameters. We find that the best learning rate scaling prescription

    would often have been excluded by the assumptions in prior work. Our results

    show that all parameterizations, not just maximal update parameterization

    (muP), can achieve hyperparameter transfer; moreover, our novel per-layer

    learning rate prescription for standard parameterization outperforms muP.

    Finally, we demonstrate that an overlooked aspect of parameterization, the

    epsilon parameter in Adam, must be scaled correctly to avoid gradient underflow

    and propose Adam-atan2, a new numerically stable, scale-invariant version of

    Adam that eliminates the epsilon hyperparameter entirely.'

    FlashAttention elaborated an approach to speed up attention on GPUs through

    35% utilization on the H100 GPU. We develop three main techniques to speed up

    attention on Hopper GPUs: exploiting asynchrony of the Tensor Cores and TMA to

    (1) overlap overall computation and data movement via warp-specialization and

    (2) interleave block-wise matmul and softmax operations, and (3) block

    quantization and incoherent processing that leverages hardware support for FP8

    low-precision. We demonstrate that our method, FlashAttention-3, achieves

    speedup on H100 GPUs by 1.5-2.0$\times$ with FP16 reaching up to 740 TFLOPs/s

    the scale of activations is independent of model size, and Unit Scaling ensures

    that activations, weights and gradients begin training with a scale of one.

    This synthesis opens the door to a simpler scheme, whose default values are

    a principled optimization framework to find optimal compositions at smaller,

    derived model. Our evaluation on GPT-2 Large and BERT pre-training demonstrates

    *AutoScale*''s effectiveness in improving training convergence and downstream

    performance. Particularly, for GPT-2 Large on RedPajama, *AutoScale* decreases

    validation perplexity 28% faster than baselines, with up to 38% speed-up over

    unweighted training, achieving the best performance across downstream tasks.

    This work provides insights into the varying benefits of data sources across

  abstract: 'Scaling the amount of compute used to train language models has dramatically

    improved their capabilities. However, when it comes to inference, we often

    limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. Here, we explore

    inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of

    generated samples. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage
    -

    the fraction of problems solved by any attempt - scales with the number of

    samples over four orders of magnitude. In domains like coding and formal

    proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified, these increases in

    coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated

    sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with

    DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250

    samples, outperforming the single-attempt state-of-the-art of 43% which uses

    more capable frontier models. Moreover, using current API pricing, amplifying

    the cheaper DeepSeek model with five samples is more cost-effective and solves

    more issues than paying a premium for one sample from GPT-4o or Claude 3.5

    Sonnet. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of

    samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power

    law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Finally, we find

    that identifying correct samples out of many generations remains an important

    direction for future research in domains without automatic verifiers. When

    solving math word problems from GSM8K and MATH, coverage with Llama-3 models

    grows to over 95% with 10,000 samples. However, common methods to pick correct

    solutions from a sample collection, such as majority voting or reward models,

    plateau beyond several hundred samples and fail to fully scale with the sample

    budget.'

  abstract: 'Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation
    is

    a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can

    operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of

    inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if

    an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time

    compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?

    Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance

    of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff

    inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little

    research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time

    inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for

    a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms

    to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based

    verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model''s distribution over a

    response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,

    the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute

    critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation

    motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most

    effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this

    compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute

    scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a

    FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model

    attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to

    outperform a 14x larger model.'

  abstract: 'We present CogVideoX, a large-scale text-to-video generation model based
    on

    diffusion transformer, which can generate 10-second continuous videos aligned

    with text prompt, with a frame rate of 16 fps and resolution of 768 * 1360

    pixels. Previous video generation models often had limited movement and short

    durations, and is difficult to generate videos with coherent narratives based

    on text. We propose several designs to address these issues. First, we propose

    a 3D Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to compress videos along both spatial and

    temporal dimensions, to improve both compression rate and video fidelity.

    Second, to improve the text-video alignment, we propose an expert transformer

    with the expert adaptive LayerNorm to facilitate the deep fusion between the

    two modalities. Third, by employing a progressive training and multi-resolution

    frame pack technique, CogVideoX is adept at producing coherent, long-duration,

    different shape videos characterized by significant motions. In addition, we

    develop an effective text-video data processing pipeline that includes various

    data preprocessing strategies and a video captioning method, greatly

    contributing to the generation quality and semantic alignment. Results show

    that CogVideoX demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both multiple

    machine metrics and human evaluations. The model weight of both 3D Causal VAE,

  abstract: 'Diffusion Models have emerged as powerful generative models for high-quality

    image synthesis, with many subsequent image editing techniques based on them.

    However, the ease of text-based image editing introduces significant risks,

    such as malicious editing for scams or intellectual property infringement.

    Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing

    by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and

    specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while

    Pixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust

    attacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploits

    vulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to

    enhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstrate

    the effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing

    methods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity and

    robustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is

    accurately reconstructing high-quality mid- and high-frequency content.

    Inspired by recent advancements in high-sample-rate music separation, speech

    enhancement, and audio codec models, we propose Apollo, a generative model

    designed for high-sample-rate audio restoration. Apollo employs an explicit

    frequency band split module to model the relationships between different

    frequency bands, allowing for more coherent and higher-quality restored audio.

    Evaluated on the MUSDB18-HQ and MoisesDB datasets, Apollo consistently

    outperforms existing SR-GAN models across various bit rates and music genres,

    particularly excelling in complex scenarios involving mixtures of multiple

    instruments and vocals. Apollo significantly improves music restoration quality

    while maintaining computational efficiency. The source code for Apollo is

    publicly available at https://github.com/JusperLee/Apollo.'

    one

    wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative

    modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising

    Diffusion Models (DDMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport

    problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However,

    these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known

    to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for

    high-dimensional data-rich problems, such as DDM-based Rectified Flow and

    Schr\"odinger Bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at

    each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant

    errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schr\"odinger Bridge, a

    dynamic entropy-regularised version of OT, that eliminates the need to train

    multiple DDM-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretisation of a

    flow of path measures, which we call the Schr\"odinger Bridge Flow, whose only

    stationary point is the Schr\"odinger Bridge. We demonstrate the performance of

  abstract: 'Data selection is of great significance in pre-training large language

    models, given the variation in quality within the large-scale available

    training corpora. To achieve this, researchers are currently investigating the

    use of data influence to measure the importance of data instances, $i.e.,$ a

    high influence score indicates that incorporating this instance to the training

    set is likely to enhance the model performance. Consequently, they select the

    top-$k$ instances with the highest scores. However, this approach has several

    limitations. (1) Computing the influence of all available data is

    time-consuming. (2) The selected data instances are not diverse enough, which

    may hinder the pre-trained model''s ability to generalize effectively to various

    downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{Quad}, a data selection

    approach that considers both quality and diversity by using data influence to

    achieve state-of-the-art pre-training results. In particular, noting that

    attention layers capture extensive semantic details, we have adapted the

    accelerated $iHVP$ computation methods for attention layers, enhancing our

    ability to evaluate the influence of data, $i.e.,$ its quality. For the

    diversity, \texttt{Quad} clusters the dataset into similar data instances

    within each cluster and diverse instances across different clusters. For each

    cluster, if we opt to select data from it, we take some samples to evaluate the

    influence to prevent processing all instances. To determine which clusters to

    select, we utilize the classic Multi-Armed Bandit method, treating each cluster

    as an arm. This approach favors clusters with highly influential instances

    (ensuring high quality) or clusters that have been selected less frequently

    (ensuring diversity), thereby well balancing between quality and diversity.'

    language

    model (LLM) development with significant interest. However, most of the

    cutting-edge progress in mathematical reasoning with LLMs has become

    \emph{closed-source} due to lack of access to training data. This lack of data

    access limits researchers from understanding the impact of different choices

    for synthesizing and utilizing the data. With the goal of creating a

    high-quality finetuning (SFT) dataset for math reasoning, we conduct careful

    ablation experiments on data synthesis using the recently released

    \texttt{Llama3.1} family of models. Our experiments show that: (a) solution

    format matters, with excessively verbose solutions proving detrimental to SFT

    performance, (b) data generated by a strong teacher outperforms equally-sized

    data generated by a weak student model, (c) SFT is robust to low-quality

    solutions, allowing for imprecise data filtering, and (d) question diversity is

    crucial for achieving data scaling gains. Based on these insights, we create

    the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset, which consists of 14M question-solution pairs

    ($\approx$ 600K unique questions), making it nearly eight times larger than the

    previous largest open-source math reasoning dataset. Finetuning the

    \texttt{Llama3.1-8B-Instruct} on MATH by an absolute 15.9\% (51.9\%

    select data based on several human-crafted metrics (rules). However, these

    conventional rule-based approaches often depend too heavily on human

    heuristics, lack effective metrics for assessing rules, and exhibit limited

    adaptability to new tasks. In our study, we introduce an innovative rule-based

    framework that utilizes the orthogonality of score vectors associated with

    rules as a novel metric for rule evaluations. Our approach includes an

    automated pipeline that first uses LLMs to generate a diverse set of rules,

    encompassing various rating dimensions to evaluate data quality. Then it rates

    a batch of data based on these rules and uses the determinantal point process

    (DPP) from random matrix theory to select the most orthogonal score vectors,

    thereby identifying a set of independent rules. These rules are subsequently

    used to evaluate all data, selecting samples with the highest average scores

    for downstream tasks such as LLM training. We verify the effectiveness of our

    method through two experimental setups: 1) comparisons with ground truth

    ratings and 2) benchmarking LLMs trained with the chosen data. Our

    comprehensive experiments cover a range of scenarios, including general

    pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning in areas such as IMDB, Medical,

    Math, and Code. The outcomes demonstrate that our DPP-based rule rating method

    consistently outperforms other approaches, including rule-free rating, uniform

  abstract: 'Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed

    elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many

    important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although

    promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies,

    existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation

    between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper,

    we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and

    influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only

    Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise

    and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any

    activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important

    phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable

    performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio

    (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing

    power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data

    for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate

    that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can

    leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the

    activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain

    bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture

    at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we

    surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly

    with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are

    insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with

    greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more

    efficient and interpretable.'

    actively harmful. For training, our scaling laws allow us to predict the loss

    of a model with different parts in different precisions, and suggest that

    training larger models in lower precision may be compute optimal. We unify the

    scaling laws for post and pretraining quantization to arrive at a single

    functional form that predicts degradation from training and inference in varied

    precisions. We fit on over 465 pretraining runs and validate our predictions on

  abstract: 'Bayes'' rule naturally allows for inference refinement in a streaming
    fashion,

    without the need to recompute posteriors from scratch whenever new data

    arrives. In principle, Bayesian streaming is straightforward: we update our

    prior with the available data and use the resulting posterior as a prior when

    processing the next data chunk. In practice, however, this recipe entails i)

    approximating an intractable posterior at each time step; and ii) encapsulating

    results appropriately to allow for posterior propagation. For continuous state

    spaces, variational inference (VI) is particularly convenient due to its

    scalability and the tractability of variational posteriors. For discrete state

    spaces, however, state-of-the-art VI results in analytically intractable

    approximations that are ill-suited for streaming settings. To enable streaming

    Bayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces, we propose streaming Bayes

    GFlowNets (abbreviated as SB-GFlowNets) by leveraging the recently proposed

    GFlowNets -- a powerful class of amortized samplers for discrete compositional

    objects. Notably, SB-GFlowNet approximates the initial posterior using a

    standard GFlowNet and subsequently updates it using a tailored procedure that

    requires only the newly observed data. Our case studies in linear preference

    learning and phylogenetic inference showcase the effectiveness of SB-GFlowNets

    in sampling from an unnormalized posterior in a streaming setting. As expected,

    we also observe that SB-GFlowNets is significantly faster than repeatedly

    training a GFlowNet from scratch to sample from the full posterior.'

  abstract: 'Large language models are increasingly becoming a cornerstone technology
    in

    artificial intelligence, the sciences, and society as a whole, yet the optimal

    strategies for dataset composition and filtering remain largely elusive. Many

    of the top-performing models lack transparency in their dataset curation and

    model development processes, posing an obstacle to the development of fully

    open language models. In this paper, we identify three core data-related

    challenges that must be addressed to advance open-source language models. These

    include (1) transparency in model development, including the data curation

    process, (2) access to large quantities of high-quality data, and (3)

    availability of artifacts and metadata for dataset curation and analysis. To

    address these challenges, we release RedPajama-V1, an open reproduction of the

    LLaMA training dataset. In addition, we release RedPajama-V2, a massive

    web-only dataset consisting of raw, unfiltered text data together with quality

    signals and metadata. Together, the RedPajama datasets comprise over 100

    trillion tokens spanning multiple domains and with their quality signals

    facilitate the filtering of data, aiming to inspire the development of numerous

    new datasets. To date, these datasets have already been used in the training of

    strong language models used in production, such as Snowflake Arctic,

    Salesforce''s XGen and AI2''s OLMo. To provide insight into the quality of

    RedPajama, we present a series of analyses and ablation studies with

    decoder-only language models with up to 1.6B parameters. Our findings

    demonstrate how quality signals for web data can be effectively leveraged to

    curate high-quality subsets of the dataset, underscoring the potential of

    RedPajama to advance the development of transparent and high-performing

    language models at scale.'

  abstract: 'Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) has emerged as a powerful tool for video

    object segmentation and tracking anything. Key components of SAM 2 that drive

    the impressive video object segmentation performance include a large multistage

    image encoder for frame feature extraction and a memory mechanism that stores

    memory contexts from past frames to help current frame segmentation. The high

    computation complexity of multistage image encoder and memory module has

    limited its applications in real-world tasks, e.g., video object segmentation

    on mobile devices. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientTAMs,

    lightweight track anything models that produce high-quality results with low

    latency and model size. Our idea is based on revisiting the plain,

    nonhierarchical Vision Transformer (ViT) as an image encoder for video object

    segmentation, and introducing an efficient memory module, which reduces the

    complexity for both frame feature extraction and memory computation for current

    frame segmentation. We take vanilla lightweight ViTs and efficient memory

    module to build EfficientTAMs, and train the models on SA-1B and SA-V datasets

    for video object segmentation and track anything tasks. We evaluate on multiple

    video segmentation benchmarks including semi-supervised VOS and promptable

    video segmentation, and find that our proposed EfficientTAM with vanilla ViT

    perform comparably to SAM 2 model (HieraB+SAM 2) with ~2x speedup on A100 and

    ~2.4x parameter reduction. On segment anything image tasks, our EfficientTAMs

    also perform favorably over original SAM with ~20x speedup on A100 and ~20x

    parameter reduction. On mobile devices such as iPhone 15 Pro Max, our

    EfficientTAMs can run at ~10 FPS for performing video object segmentation with

    reasonable quality, highlighting the capability of small models for on-device

    video object segmentation applications.'

  abstract: 'As a fundamental backbone for video generation, diffusion models are

    challenged by low inference speed due to the sequential nature of denoising.

    Previous methods speed up the models by caching and reusing model outputs at

    uniformly selected timesteps. However, such a strategy neglects the fact that

    differences among model outputs are not uniform across timesteps, which hinders

    selecting the appropriate model outputs to cache, leading to a poor balance

    between inference efficiency and visual quality. In this study, we introduce

    Timestep Embedding Aware Cache (TeaCache), a training-free caching approach

    that estimates and leverages the fluctuating differences among model outputs

    across timesteps. Rather than directly using the time-consuming model outputs,

    TeaCache focuses on model inputs, which have a strong correlation with the

    modeloutputs while incurring negligible computational cost. TeaCache first

    modulates the noisy inputs using the timestep embeddings to ensure their

    differences better approximating those of model outputs. TeaCache then

    introduces a rescaling strategy to refine the estimated differences and

    utilizes them to indicate output caching. Experiments show that TeaCache

    achieves up to 4.41x acceleration over Open-Sora-Plan with negligible (-0.07%

    Vbench score) degradation of visual quality.'

  abstract: 'Removing modeling constraints and unifying architectures across domains
    has

    been a key driver of the recent progress in training large multimodal models.

    However, most of these models still rely on many separately trained components

    such as modality-specific encoders and decoders. In this work, we further

    streamline joint generative modeling of images and text. We propose an

    autoregressive decoder-only transformer - JetFormer - which is trained to

    directly maximize the likelihood of raw data, without relying on any separately

    pretrained components, and can understand and generate both text and images.

    Specifically, we leverage a normalizing flow model to obtain a soft-token image

    representation that is jointly trained with an autoregressive multimodal

    transformer. The normalizing flow model serves as both an image encoder for

    perception tasks and an image decoder for image generation tasks during

    inference. JetFormer achieves text-to-image generation quality competitive with

    recent VQ-VAE- and VAE-based baselines. These baselines rely on pretrained

    image autoencoders, which are trained with a complex mixture of losses,

    including perceptual ones. At the same time, JetFormer demonstrates robust

    image understanding capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, JetFormer is

    the first model that is capable of generating high-fidelity images and

  abstract: 'Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes
    or an

    inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed

    cheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this

    hierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [Zeng et al.,

    2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of

    Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al.,

    2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in

    modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure:

    a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label

    hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a

    simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based

    representation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any

    standard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments

    on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of

    HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance

    especially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of

    structured representation, we perform eigenvalue analysis that links the

  abstract: 'The development and evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has primarily

    focused on their task-solving capabilities, with recent models even surpassing

    human performance in some areas. However, this focus often neglects whether

    machine-generated language matches the human level of diversity, in terms of

    vocabulary choice, syntactic construction, and expression of meaning, raising

    questions about whether the fundamentals of language generation have been fully

    addressed. This paper emphasizes the importance of examining the preservation

    of human linguistic richness by language models, given the concerning surge in

    online content produced or aided by LLMs. We propose a comprehensive framework

    for evaluating LLMs from various linguistic diversity perspectives including

    lexical, syntactic, and semantic dimensions. Using this framework, we benchmark

    several state-of-the-art LLMs across all diversity dimensions, and conduct an

    in-depth case study for syntactic diversity. Finally, we analyze how different

    development and deployment choices impact the linguistic diversity of LLM

    outputs.'

  abstract: 'Modeling human behavior is essential to accurately predict epidemic spread,

    with behaviors like vaccine hesitancy complicating control efforts. While

    epidemic spread is often treated as a simple contagion, vaccine uptake may

    follow complex contagion dynamics, where individuals'' decisions depend on

    multiple social contacts. Recently, the concept of complex contagion has

    received strong theoretical underpinnings thanks to the generalization of

    spreading phenomena from pairwise to higher-order interactions. Although

    several potential applications have been suggested, examples of complex

    contagions motivated by real data remain scarce. Surveys on COVID-19 vaccine

    hesitancy in the US suggest that vaccination attitudes may indeed depend on the

    vaccination status of social peers, aligning with complex contagion principles.

    In this work, we examine the interactions between epidemic spread, vaccination,

    and vaccine uptake attitudes under complex contagion. Using the SIR model with

    a dynamic, threshold-based vaccination campaign, we simulate scenarios on an

    age-structured multilayer network informed by US contact data. Our results

    offer insights into the role of social dynamics in shaping vaccination behavior

    and epidemic outcomes.'

  abstract: 'In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods
    for

    training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to

    stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning

    rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by

    their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning

    rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent

    training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer''s

    memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency,

    SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of

    Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of

    using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K

    classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large

    language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to

    hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further

    tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion

    models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a

    memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for

    optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters)

    and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training

  abstract: 'Attention heads are one of the building blocks of large language models

    (LLMs). Prior work on investigating their operation mostly focused on analyzing

    their behavior during inference for specific circuits or tasks. In this work,

    we seek a comprehensive mapping of the operations they implement in a model. We

    propose MAPS (Mapping Attention head ParameterS), an efficient framework that

    infers the functionality of attention heads from their parameters, without any

    model training or inference. We showcase the utility of MAPS for answering two

    types of questions: (a) given a predefined operation, mapping how strongly

    heads across the model implement it, and (b) given an attention head, inferring

    its salient functionality. Evaluating MAPS on 20 operations across 6 popular

    LLMs shows its estimations correlate with the head''s outputs during inference

    and are causally linked to the model''s predictions. Moreover, its mappings

    reveal attention heads of certain operations that were overlooked in previous

    studies, and valuable insights on function universality and architecture biases

    in LLMs. Next, we present an automatic pipeline and analysis that leverage MAPS

    to characterize the salient operations of a given head. Our pipeline produces

    plausible operation descriptions for most heads, as assessed by human judgment,

    or speculation but on solid scientific evidence. I argue that such evidence is

    hard to come by and that the only justifiable stance on the prospects of

    artificial consciousness is agnosticism. In the current debate, the main

    division is between biological views that are sceptical of artificial

    consciousness and functional views that are sympathetic to it. I argue that

    both camps make the same mistake of over-estimating what the evidence tells us.

    Scientific insights into consciousness have been achieved through the study of

    conscious organisms. Although this has enabled cautious assessments of

    consciousness in various creatures, extending this to AI faces serious

    obstacles. AI thus presents consciousness researchers with a dilemma: either

    reach a verdict on artificial consciousness but violate Evidentialism; or

    respect Evidentialism but offer no verdict on the prospects of artificial

    consciousness. The dominant trend in the literature has been to take the first

    option while purporting to follow the scientific evidence. I argue that if we

    the

    efficiency and quality of Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding and

    answering queries, especially complex ones in scenarios like

    Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, RAG mitigates the

    limitations of LLMs by dynamically retrieving and leveraging up-to-date

    relevant information, which provides a cost-effective solution to the challenge

    of LLMs producing plausible but potentially inaccurate responses. Recently, as

    RAG evolves and incorporates multiple components that influence its

    performance, QO has emerged as a critical element, playing a pivotal role in

    determining the effectiveness of RAG''s retrieval stage in accurately sourcing

    the necessary multiple pieces of evidence to answer queries correctly. In this

    paper, we trace the evolution of QO techniques by summarizing and analyzing

    significant studies. Through an organized framework and categorization, we aim

    to consolidate existing QO techniques in RAG, elucidate their technological

    foundations, and highlight their potential to enhance the versatility and

  abstract: 'With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein

    not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to

    alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and

    trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This

    paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this

    opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated

    Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target

    phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended

    novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse

    simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a

    diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life,

    Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential

    of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids

    lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway''s Game

    of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of

    previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm

    promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human

    speech, and video datasets--from their detailed sourcing trends and use

    restrictions to their geographical and linguistic representation. Our manual

    analysis covers nearly 4000 public datasets between 1990-2024, spanning 608

    multimodal machine learning applications have overwhelmingly turned to

    web-crawled, synthetic, and social media platforms, such as YouTube, for their

    training sets, eclipsing all other sources since 2019. Secondly, tracing the

    chain of dataset derivations we find that while less than 33% of datasets are

    restrictively licensed, over 80% of the source content in widely-used text,

    speech, and video datasets, carry non-commercial restrictions. Finally, counter

    to the rising number of languages and geographies represented in public AI

    training datasets, our audit demonstrates measures of relative geographical and

    multilingual representation have failed to significantly improve their coverage

    since 2013. We believe the breadth of our audit enables us to empirically

    examine trends in data sourcing, restrictions, and Western-centricity at an

    ecosystem-level, and that visibility into these questions are essential to

    progress in responsible AI. As a contribution to ongoing improvements in

  abstract: 'The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems,
    as the

    success of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into

    popular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language

    processing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for

    recommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods

    typically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting,

    which we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1)

    semantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items

    contribute most of the positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the

    cold-start problem that hinders the recommender quality on cold-start items. We

    propose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as

    prompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We

    experimentally prove that compared to the content description proposed in

    existing works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt

  abstract: 'Intuitively, an ideal collaborative filtering (CF) model should learn
    from

    users'' full rankings over all items to make optimal top-K recommendations. Due

    to the absence of such full rankings in practice, most CF models rely on

    pairwise loss functions to approximate full rankings, resulting in an immense

    performance gap. In this paper, we provide a novel analysis using the multiple

    ordinal classification concept to reveal the inevitable gap between a pairwise

    approximation and the ideal case. However, bridging the gap in practice

    encounters two formidable challenges: (1) none of the real-world datasets

    contains full ranking information; (2) there does not exist a loss function

    that is capable of consuming ranking information. To overcome these challenges,

    we propose a pseudo-ranking paradigm (PRP) that addresses the lack of ranking

    information by introducing pseudo-rankings supervised by an original noise

    injection mechanism. Additionally, we put forward a new ranking loss function

    designed to handle ranking information effectively. To ensure our method''s

    robustness against potential inaccuracies in pseudo-rankings, we equip the

    ranking loss function with a gradient-based confidence mechanism to detect and

    mitigate abnormal gradients. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets

    demonstrate that PRP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.'

  abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet

    struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex

    knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies

    have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale

    knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of

    answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant

    data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge

    aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question

    and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect

    Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge

    including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of

    retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key

    sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among

    entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing

    noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to

    learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to

    determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs'' output, or even

    filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on

    two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy

    over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation

    over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These

    results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of

    LLMs.'

  abstract: 'We introduce a bootstrapping approach to train long-context language
    models

    by exploiting their short-context capabilities only. Our method utilizes a

    simple agent workflow to synthesize diverse long-context instruction tuning

    data, thereby eliminating the necessity for manual data collection and

    annotation. The proposed data synthesis workflow requires only a short-context

    language model, a text retriever, and a document collection, all of which are

    readily accessible within the open-source ecosystem. Subsequently, language

    models are fine-tuned using the synthesized data to extend their context

    lengths. In this manner, we effectively transfer the short-context capabilities

    of language models to long-context scenarios through a bootstrapping process.

    We conduct experiments with the open-source Llama-3 family of models and

    demonstrate that our method can successfully extend the context length to up to

    1M tokens, achieving superior performance across various benchmarks.'

    answered is to directly connect with experts on the topic and have a

    allowed knowledge to be materialized, preserved, and replicated, enabling the

  abstract: 'Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized a wide range of domains
    such

    as natural language processing, computer vision, and multi-modal tasks due to

    their ability to comprehend context and perform logical reasoning. However, the

    computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose

    significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and

    real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a

    critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing

    redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides
    a

    comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration,

    categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level

    optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget

    allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while

    model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention

    mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory

    management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across

    diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview

    of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these

    strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this

    work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support

    the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques,

    contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.
