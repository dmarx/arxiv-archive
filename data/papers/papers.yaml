    a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly

    bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also

    perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations

    for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn

    distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically

    well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep

    ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible

    explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable

    ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this

    hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of

    neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of

    In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of

    randomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to

    achieve 90\% of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we

    empirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension

    and, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension

    after a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their

    extreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low

    well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that

    training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to

    gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple

    weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced

    by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on
    a

    regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when

    training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the

    models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the

    weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained

    Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in

    their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression

    problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context

    learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore

    identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by

    learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data

    intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context

  abstract: 'Transfer learning has recently become the dominant paradigm of machine

    learning. Pre-trained models fine-tuned for downstream tasks achieve better

    performance with fewer labelled examples. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how

    to develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring

    distributed tasks. Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to

    these challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented

    as autonomous parameter-efficient modules. Information is conditionally routed

    to a subset of modules and subsequently aggregated. These properties enable

    positive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from

    routing and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular

    architectures, providing a unified view over several threads of research that

    evolved independently in the scientific literature. Moreover, we explore

    various additional purposes of modularity, including scaling language models,

    causal inference, programme induction, and planning in reinforcement learning.

    Finally, we report various concrete applications where modularity has been

    successfully deployed such as cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

  abstract: 'Protecting personal data against exploitation of machine learning models
    is

    crucial. Recently, availability attacks have shown great promise to provide an

    extra layer of protection against the unauthorized use of data to train neural

    networks. These methods aim to add imperceptible noise to clean data so that

    the neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data,

    claiming that they can make personal data "unexploitable." This paper provides

    a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable

    data might only be an illusion. In particular, we leverage the power of

    diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can

    counteract the effectiveness of the data-protecting perturbations. We

    rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of

    required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting

    perturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-of-the-art

    performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various

    scenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch

    between the diffusion model and the protected data. Our findings call for more

    research into making personal data unexploitable, showing that this goal is far

    from over. Our implementation is available at this repository:

  abstract: 'Adversarial examples for diffusion models are widely used as solutions

    safety concerns. By adding adversarial perturbations to personal images,

    attackers can not edit or imitate them easily. However, it is essential to note

    that all these protections target the latent diffusion model (LDMs), the

    adversarial examples for diffusion models in the pixel space (PDMs) are largely

    vulnerable to adversarial attacks like most deep models. In this paper, we show

    novel findings that: even though gradient-based white-box attacks can be used

    to attack the LDMs, they fail to attack PDMs. This finding is supported by

    extensive experiments of almost a wide range of attacking methods on various

    PDMs and LDMs with different model structures, which means diffusion models are

    indeed much more robust against adversarial attacks. We also find that PDMs can

    be used as an off-the-shelf purifier to effectively remove the adversarial

    patterns that were generated on LDMs to protect the images, which means that

    most protection methods nowadays, to some extent, cannot protect our images

  abstract: 'Generative AI models are often used to perform mimicry attacks, where
    a

    pretrained model is fine-tuned on a small sample of images to learn to mimic a

    specific artist of interest. While researchers have introduced multiple

    anti-mimicry protection tools (Mist, Glaze, Anti-Dreambooth), recent evidence

    points to a growing trend of mimicry models using videos as sources of training

    data. This paper presents our experiences exploring techniques to disrupt style

    mimicry on video imagery. We first validate that mimicry attacks can succeed by

    training on individual frames extracted from videos. We show that while

    anti-mimicry tools can offer protection when applied to individual frames, this

    approach is vulnerable to an adaptive countermeasure that removes protection by

    exploiting randomness in optimization results of consecutive (nearly-identical)

    frames. We develop a new, tool-agnostic framework that segments videos into

    short scenes based on frame-level similarity, and use a per-scene optimization

    baseline to remove inter-frame randomization while reducing computational cost.

    We show via both image level metrics and an end-to-end user study that the

    countermeasure). Finally, we develop another adaptive countermeasure and find

    that it falls short against our framework.'

  abstract: 'While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often

    attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from

    data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain

    elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing

    lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that

    transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how

    unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine

    the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to

    influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that

    constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and

    function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with

    multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with

    piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature

    learning only occurs from balanced initializations, where all layers learn at

    similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that

    promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through

    a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime

    drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes

    interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of

    learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular

    arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced

    orthogonal function expansions. For distributions over $\mathbb{R}^D$, the

    lowest order term in these expansions provides a Gaussian variational

    approximation, while higher-order terms provide a systematic way to model

    non-Gaussianity. These approximations are flexible enough to model complex

    distributions (multimodal, asymmetric), but they are simple enough that one can

    calculate their low-order moments and draw samples from them. EigenVI can also

    model other types of random variables (e.g., nonnegative, bounded) by

    constructing variational approximations from different families of orthogonal

    functions. Within these families, EigenVI computes the variational

    approximation that best matches the score function of the target distribution

    effectively sidesteps the iterative gradient-based optimizations that are

    challenging. We introduce LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a principled

    framework that formulates reasoning as sampling from a latent distribution and

    optimizes it via variational approaches. LaTRO enables LLMs to concurrently

    improve both their reasoning process and ability to evaluate reasoning quality,

    without requiring external feedback or reward models. We validate LaTRO through

    experiments on GSM8K and ARC-Challenge datasets using multiple model

    architectures. On GSM8K, LaTRO improves zero-shot accuracy by an average of

    12.5% over base models and 9.6% over supervised fine-tuning across

    Phi-3.5-mini, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B. Our findings suggest that

    pre-trained LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked and

    enhanced through our proposed optimization approach in a self-improvement

    manner. The code of LaTRO is available at

    \url{https://github.com/SalesforceAIResearch/LaTRO}.'

  abstract: 'Language models (LMs), like other neural networks, often favor shortcut

    heuristics based on surface-level patterns. Although LMs behave like n-gram

    models early in training, they must eventually learn hierarchical syntactic

    representations to correctly apply grammatical rules out-of-distribution (OOD).

    In this work, we use case studies of English grammar to explore how complex,

    diverse training data drives models to generalize OOD. We construct a framework

    that unifies our understanding of random variation with training dynamics, rule

    selection with memorization, and data diversity with complexity. We show that

    these factors are nuanced, and that intermediate levels of diversity and

    complexity lead to inconsistent behavior across random seeds and to unstable

    training dynamics. Our findings emphasize the critical role of training data in

    shaping generalization patterns and illuminate how competing model strategies

    lead to inconsistent generalization outcomes across random seeds. Code is

    available at https://github.com/sunnytqin/concept_comp.git.'

  abstract: 'Could an AI have conscious experiences? Any answer to this question should

    conform to Evidentialism - that is, it should be based not on intuition, dogma

    or speculation but on solid scientific evidence. I argue that such evidence is

    hard to come by and that the only justifiable stance on the prospects of

    artificial consciousness is agnosticism. In the current debate, the main

    division is between biological views that are sceptical of artificial

    consciousness and functional views that are sympathetic to it. I argue that

    both camps make the same mistake of over-estimating what the evidence tells us.

    Scientific insights into consciousness have been achieved through the study of

    conscious organisms. Although this has enabled cautious assessments of

    consciousness in various creatures, extending this to AI faces serious

    obstacles. AI thus presents consciousness researchers with a dilemma: either

    reach a verdict on artificial consciousness but violate Evidentialism; or

    respect Evidentialism but offer no verdict on the prospects of artificial

    consciousness. The dominant trend in the literature has been to take the first

    option while purporting to follow the scientific evidence. I argue that if we

    truly follow the evidence, we must take the second option and adopt

    agnosticism.'

    tradeoff for retrieval and classification tasks with respect to larger

    optimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto

    improvement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native

    8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a

    large pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both

    single and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In

    addition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed

  abstract: 'With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein

    discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces

    promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has

    not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to

    alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and

    trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This

    paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this

    opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated

    Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target

    phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended

    novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse

    simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a

    diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life,

    Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential

    of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids

    lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway''s Game

    of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of

    previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm

    promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human

    ingenuity alone.'
