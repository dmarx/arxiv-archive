  abstract: "Hyperbolicity is a property of a graph that may be viewed as being a\
    \ \"soft\"\nversion of a tree, and recent empirical and theoretical work has suggested\
    \ that\nmany graphs arising in Internet and related data applications have hyperbolic\n\
    properties. We consider Gromov's notion of \\delta-hyperbolicity, and establish\n\
    several results for small-world and tree-like random graph models. First, we\n\
    study the hyperbolicity of Kleinberg small-world random graphs and show that\n\
    the hyperbolicity of these random graphs is not significantly improved\ncomparing\
    \ to graph diameter even when it greatly improves decentralized\nnavigation. Next\
    \ we study a class of tree-like graphs called ringed trees that\nhave constant\
    \ hyperbolicity. We show that adding random links among the leaves\nsimilar to\
    \ the small-world graph constructions may easily destroy the\nhyperbolicity of\
    \ the graphs, except for a class of random edges added using an\nexponentially\
    \ decaying probability function based on the ring distance among\nthe leaves.\n\
    \  Our study provides one of the first significant analytical results on the\n\
    hyperbolicity of a rich class of random graphs, which shed light on the\nrelationship\
    \ between hyperbolicity and navigability of random graphs, as well\nas on the\
    \ sensitivity of hyperbolic {\\delta} to noises in random graphs."

  abstract: 'A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning

    algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to

    average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole

    ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to

    allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual

    models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it

    is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which

    is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different

    compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show

    that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used

    commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a

    single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more

    full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained

    classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these

    specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.'

    a

  abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words
    of

    the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in

    hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of

    the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape

    (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to

    minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or

    time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast

    that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different

    piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways

    to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a

    "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how

    much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years

    have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of

    approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to

    data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly

    used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture

    processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine

    learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book

    reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data

    sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it

    particularly useful for some of these applications.'

  abstract: 'Many recently trained neural networks employ large numbers of parameters
    to

    achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters

    required as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are

    such notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt

    to answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter

    space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase

    the dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear,

    and define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The

    approach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces

    several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions

    than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies

    little across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter

    result has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough

    to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the

    dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some

    quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement,

    and other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the

    inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from

    MNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying

    CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes

    wandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for

    constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a

    solution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing

    networks, in some cases by more than 100 times.'

  abstract: 'Not all neural network architectures are created equal, some perform
    much

    better than others for certain tasks. But how important are the weight

    parameters of a neural network compared to its architecture? In this work, we

    question to what extent neural network architectures alone, without learning

    any weight parameters, can encode solutions for a given task. We propose a

    search method for neural network architectures that can already perform a task

    without any explicit weight training. To evaluate these networks, we populate

    the connections with a single shared weight parameter sampled from a uniform

    random distribution, and measure the expected performance. We demonstrate that

    our method can find minimal neural network architectures that can perform

    several reinforcement learning tasks without weight training. On a supervised

    learning domain, we find network architectures that achieve much higher than

    chance accuracy on MNIST using random weights. Interactive version of this

  abstract: 'Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach
    for

    improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep

    learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the

    bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also

    perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations

    for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn

    distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically

    well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep

    ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible

    explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable

    variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep

    ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this

    hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of

    neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of

    functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random

    initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an

    optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a

    single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight

    space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that

    the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular

    subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of

    ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and

    the experimental results validate our hypothesis.'

  abstract: 'A basic operation in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is spatial
    resizing

    of feature maps. This is done either by strided convolution (donwscaling) or

    transposed convolution (upscaling). Such operations are limited to a fixed

    filter moving at predetermined integer steps (strides). Spatial sizes of

    consecutive layers are related by integer scale factors, predetermined at

    architectural design, and remain fixed throughout training and inference time.

    We propose a generalization of the common Conv-layer, from a discrete layer to

    a Continuous Convolution (CC) Layer. CC Layers naturally extend Conv-layers by

    representing the filter as a learned continuous function over sub-pixel

    coordinates. This allows learnable and principled resizing of feature maps, to

    any size, dynamically and consistently across scales. Once trained, the CC

    layer can be used to output any scale/size chosen at inference time. The scale

    can be non-integer and differ between the axes. CC gives rise to new freedoms

    for architectural design, such as dynamic layer shapes at inference time, or

    gradual architectures where the size changes by a small factor at each layer.

    This gives rise to many desired CNN properties, new architectural design

    capabilities, and useful applications. We further show that current Conv-layers

    suffer from inherent misalignments, which are ameliorated by CC layers.'

    deep

    neural networks (DNNs) into neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines, whose

    training dynamics is well-approximated by a linear weight expansion of the

    network at initialization. Standard training, however, diverges from its

    linearization in ways that are poorly understood. We study the relationship

    between the training dynamics of nonlinear deep networks, the geometry of the

    loss landscape, and the time evolution of a data-dependent NTK. We do so

    through a large-scale phenomenological analysis of training, synthesizing

    diverse measures characterizing loss landscape geometry and NTK dynamics. In

    multiple neural architectures and datasets, we find these diverse measures

    evolve in a highly correlated manner, revealing a universal picture of the deep

    learning process. In this picture, deep network training exhibits a highly

    chaotic rapid initial transient that within 2 to 3 epochs determines the final

    linearly connected basin of low loss containing the end point of training.

    During this chaotic transient, the NTK changes rapidly, learning useful

    features from the training data that enables it to outperform the standard

    initial NTK by a factor of 3 in less than 3 to 4 epochs. After this rapid

    chaotic transient, the NTK changes at constant velocity, and its performance

    matches that of full network training in 15% to 45% of training time. Overall,

    our analysis reveals a striking correlation between a diverse set of metrics

    over training time, governed by a rapid chaotic to stable transition in the

    first few epochs, that together poses challenges and opportunities for the

    development of more accurate theories of deep learning.'

  abstract: 'Although pretrained language models can be fine-tuned to produce

    state-of-the-art results for a very wide range of language understanding tasks,

    the dynamics of this process are not well understood, especially in the low

    data regime. Why can we use relatively vanilla gradient descent algorithms

    (e.g., without strong regularization) to tune a model with hundreds of millions

    of parameters on datasets with only hundreds or thousands of labeled examples?

    In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of

    intrinsic dimension provides us with empirical and theoretical intuitions to

    explain this remarkable phenomenon. We empirically show that common pre-trained

    models have a very low intrinsic dimension; in other words, there exists a low

    dimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full

    parameter space. For example, by optimizing only 200 trainable parameters

    randomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to

    achieve 90\% of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we

    empirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension

    and, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension

    after a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their

    extreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low

    dimensional task representations and compression based generalization bounds to

    provide intrinsic-dimension-based generalization bounds that are independent of

    the full parameter count.'

  abstract: 'Adapting large-scale pretrained language models to downstream tasks via

    fine-tuning is the standard method for achieving state-of-the-art performance

    on NLP benchmarks. However, fine-tuning all weights of models with millions or

    billions of parameters is sample-inefficient, unstable in low-resource

    settings, and wasteful as it requires storing a separate copy of the model for

    each task. Recent work has developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,

    but these approaches either still require a relatively large number of

    parameters or underperform standard fine-tuning. In this work, we propose

    Compacter, a method for fine-tuning large-scale language models with a better

    trade-off between task performance and the number of trainable parameters than

    prior work. Compacter accomplishes this by building on top of ideas from

    adapters, low-rank optimization, and parameterized hypercomplex multiplication

    layers. Specifically, Compacter inserts task-specific weight matrices into a

    pretrained model''s weights, which are computed efficiently as a sum of

    Kronecker products between shared "slow" weights and "fast" rank-one matrices

    defined per Compacter layer. By only training 0.047% of a pretrained model''s

    parameters, Compacter performs on par with standard fine-tuning on GLUE and

    outperforms standard fine-tuning on SuperGLUE and low-resource settings. Our

  abstract: 'We investigate the optimal model size and number of tokens for training
    a

    transformer language model under a given compute budget. We find that current

    large language models are significantly undertrained, a consequence of the

    recent focus on scaling language models whilst keeping the amount of training

    data constant. By training over 400 language models ranging from 70 million to

    over 16 billion parameters on 5 to 500 billion tokens, we find that for

    compute-optimal training, the model size and the number of training tokens

    should be scaled equally: for every doubling of model size the number of

    training tokens should also be doubled. We test this hypothesis by training a

    predicted compute-optimal model, Chinchilla, that uses the same compute budget

    as Gopher but with 70B parameters and 4$\times$ more more data. Chinchilla

    uniformly and significantly outperforms Gopher (280B), GPT-3 (175B), Jurassic-1

    (178B), and Megatron-Turing NLG (530B) on a large range of downstream

    compute for fine-tuning and inference, greatly facilitating downstream usage.

    As a highlight, Chinchilla reaches a state-of-the-art average accuracy of 67.5%

    on the MMLU benchmark, greater than a 7% improvement over Gopher.'

    and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory

    requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g.,

    sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread

    adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality

    tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable

    algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues,

    we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are

    parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware

    utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms).

    Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch

    matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties

    of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense

    models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable

    accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training

    applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and

    Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and

    reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In

    sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called "reverse

    sparsification," Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation

    to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The

    same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized

    implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse

    fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds

    up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.'

  abstract: 'The presence of obstacles is intuitively expected to hinder the diffusive

    transport of micro-swimmers. However, for chiral micro-swimmers, a low density

    of obstacles near a surface can enhance their diffusive behavior, due to the

    rectification of the chiral motion by the obstacles. Here, we study numerically

    the role that disorder plays in determining the transport dynamics of chiral

    micro-swimmers on surfaces with obstacles. We consider different densities of

    regularly spaced obstacles and distinct types of disorder: noise in the

    dynamics of the micro-swimmer, quenched noise in the positions of the obstacles

    as well as obstacle size polydispersity. We show that, depending on the type

    and strength of the disorder, the presence of obstacles can either enhance or

    hinder transport, and discuss implications for the control of active transport

    in disordered media.'

  abstract: 'Spectral analysis provides one of the most effective paradigms for

    information-preserving dimensionality reduction, as simple descriptions of

    naturally occurring signals are often obtained via few terms of periodic basis

    functions. In this work, we study deep neural networks designed to harness the

    structure in frequency domain for efficient learning of long-range correlations

    in space or time: frequency-domain models (FDMs). Existing FDMs are based on

    complex-valued transforms i.e. Fourier Transforms (FT), and layers that perform

    computation on the spectrum and input data separately. This design introduces

    considerable computational overhead: for each layer, a forward and inverse FT.

    Instead, this work introduces a blueprint for frequency domain learning through

    a single transform: transform once (T1). To enable efficient, direct learning

    in the frequency domain we derive a variance-preserving weight initialization

    scheme and investigate methods for frequency selection in reduced-order FDMs.

    Our results noticeably streamline the design process of FDMs, pruning redundant

    transforms, and leading to speedups of 3x to 10x that increase with data

    resolution and model size. We perform extensive experiments on learning the

    solution operator of spatio-temporal dynamics, including incompressible

  abstract: 'At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are
    not

    well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that

    training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to

    gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple

    weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced

    by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on
    a

    regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when

    training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the

    models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the

    weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained

    Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in

    their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression

    problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context

    learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore

    identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by

    learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data

    representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss

    intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context

    learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be

    understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent

    learning within Transformers. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at

  abstract: 'State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence

    modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language

    modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead

    of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware

    utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity

    gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the

    hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language

    modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that

    existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the

    sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on

    language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed

    for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes

    within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid

    125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers

    surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to

    improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose

    FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on

    sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that

    exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.

    FlashConv yields 2$\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows

    hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\times$ faster than Transformers.

    Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B

    parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower

    perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and

    few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.'

    performance with fewer labelled examples. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how

    to develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring

    negative interference and that generalise systematically to non-identically

    distributed tasks. Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to

    these challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented

    as autonomous parameter-efficient modules. Information is conditionally routed

    to a subset of modules and subsequently aggregated. These properties enable

    positive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from

    routing and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular

    architectures, providing a unified view over several threads of research that

    evolved independently in the scientific literature. Moreover, we explore

    various additional purposes of modularity, including scaling language models,

    causal inference, programme induction, and planning in reinforcement learning.

    Finally, we report various concrete applications where modularity has been

  abstract: 'Protecting personal data against exploitation of machine learning models
    is

    crucial. Recently, availability attacks have shown great promise to provide an

    extra layer of protection against the unauthorized use of data to train neural

    networks. These methods aim to add imperceptible noise to clean data so that

    the neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data,

    claiming that they can make personal data "unexploitable." This paper provides

    a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable

    data might only be an illusion. In particular, we leverage the power of

    diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can

    counteract the effectiveness of the data-protecting perturbations. We

    rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of

    required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting

    perturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-of-the-art

    performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various

    scenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch

    between the diffusion model and the protected data. Our findings call for more

    research into making personal data unexploitable, showing that this goal is far

    from over. Our implementation is available at this repository:

  abstract: 'Time series modeling is a well-established problem, which often requires
    that

    methods (1) expressively represent complicated dependencies, (2) forecast long

    horizons, and (3) efficiently train over long sequences. State-space models

    (SSMs) are classical models for time series, and prior works combine SSMs with

    deep learning layers for efficient sequence modeling. However, we find

    fundamental limitations with these prior approaches, proving their SSM

    representations cannot express autoregressive time series processes. We thus

    introduce SpaceTime, a new state-space time series architecture that improves

    all three criteria. For expressivity, we propose a new SSM parameterization

    based on the companion matrix -- a canonical representation for discrete-time

    processes -- which enables SpaceTime''s SSM layers to learn desirable

    autoregressive processes. For long horizon forecasting, we introduce a

    "closed-loop" variation of the companion SSM, which enables SpaceTime to

    predict many future time-steps by generating its own layer-wise inputs. For

    efficient training and inference, we introduce an algorithm that reduces the

    memory and compute of a forward pass with the companion matrix. With sequence

    length $\ell$ and state-space size $d$, we go from $\tilde{O}(d \ell)$

    na\"ively to $\tilde{O}(d + \ell)$. In experiments, our contributions lead to

    state-of-the-art results on extensive and diverse benchmarks, with best or

    second-best AUROC on 6 / 7 ECG and speech time series classification, and best

    MSE on 14 / 16 Informer forecasting tasks. Furthermore, we find SpaceTime (1)

    fits AR($p$) processes that prior deep SSMs fail on, (2) forecasts notably more

    accurately on longer horizons than prior state-of-the-art, and (3) speeds up

    training on real-world ETTh1 data by 73% and 80% relative wall-clock time over

    Transformers and LSTMs.'

  abstract: 'Inversion by Direct Iteration (InDI) is a new formulation for supervised

    image restoration that avoids the so-called "regression to the mean" effect and

    produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based

    methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps,

    similar to generative denoising diffusion models. Image restoration is an

    ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images are plausible

    reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the outcome of a

    single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all possible

    explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main advantage of InDI

    is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in a single step but

    instead gradually improves the image in small steps, resulting in better

    perceptual quality. While generative denoising diffusion models also work in

    small steps, our formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge

    of any analytic form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an

    iterative restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired

    examples. InDI can be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired

    training data. In conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the

    denoising network generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an

    initial image of pure noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to

    conditional denoising formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively

    restoring the input low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a

    variety of image restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus

    deblurring, super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising.'

  abstract: 'Recent work claims that large language models display emergent abilities,

    abilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale

    models. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness,

    transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their

    unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we

    present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a

    particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent

    abilities appear due to the researcher''s choice of metric rather than due to

    fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or

    discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or

    continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model

    performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical

    model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm

    three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3

    family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two

    predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on

    BIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen

    seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep

    networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent

    abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may

    not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.'

  abstract: 'Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a leading approach
    for

    generating high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of

    these models exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking that divides the

    generative dynamics into two distinct phases: 1) A linear steady-state dynamics

    around a central fixed-point and 2) an attractor dynamics directed towards the

    data manifold. These two "phases" are separated by the change in stability of

    the central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being

    responsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical

    and empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early

    dynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early

    fluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight,

    we propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves

    model performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while

    also increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA

    images). Our work offers a new way to understand the generative dynamics of

    diffusion models that has the potential to bring about higher performance and

    less biased fast-samplers.'

  abstract: 'Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem
    in

    the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling

    and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications

    in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main

    bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase

    quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric

    GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of

    quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\times$ compared to optimized baselines),

    with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as

    optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\% of the

    theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to

    suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the

    GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We

    propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these

    issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of

    non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single

    head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each

    thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through

    shared memory. These yield around 2$\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention,

    reaching 50-73\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close

    to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used

    end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed

    of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\% model FLOPs utilization).'

    Moreover, CoLA provides memory efficient automatic differentiation, low

  abstract: 'Structure learning is the crux of causal inference. Notably, causal discovery

    (CD) algorithms are brittle when data is scarce, possibly inferring imprecise

    causal relations that contradict expert knowledge -- especially when

    considering latent confounders. To aggravate the issue, most CD methods do not

    provide uncertainty estimates, making it hard for users to interpret results

    and improve the inference process. Surprisingly, while CD is a human-centered

    affair, no works have focused on building methods that both 1) output

    uncertainty estimates that can be verified by experts and 2) interact with

    those experts to iteratively refine CD. To solve these issues, we start by

    proposing to sample (causal) ancestral graphs proportionally to a belief

    distribution based on a score function, such as the Bayesian information

    criterion (BIC), using generative flow networks. Then, we leverage the

    diversity in candidate graphs and introduce an optimal experimental design to

    iteratively probe the expert about the relations among variables, effectively

    reducing the uncertainty of our belief over ancestral graphs. Finally, we

    update our samples to incorporate human feedback via importance sampling.

    Importantly, our method does not require causal sufficiency (i.e., unobserved

    confounders may exist). Experiments with synthetic observational data show that

    our method can accurately sample from distributions over ancestral graphs and

    that we can greatly improve inference quality with human aid.'

  abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) with hundreds of billions of parameters
    have

    sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, they are

    computationally expensive at inference time. Sparsity is a natural approach to

    reduce this cost, but existing methods either require costly retraining, have

    to forgo LLM''s in-context learning ability, or do not yield wall-clock time

    speedup on modern hardware. We hypothesize that contextual sparsity, which are

    small, input-dependent sets of attention heads and MLP parameters that yield

    approximately the same output as the dense model for a given input, can address

    these issues. We show that contextual sparsity exists, that it can be

    accurately predicted, and that we can exploit it to speed up LLM inference in

    wall-clock time without compromising LLM''s quality or in-context learning

    ability. Based on these insights, we propose DejaVu, a system that uses a

    low-cost algorithm to predict contextual sparsity on the fly given inputs to

    each layer, along with an asynchronous and hardware-aware implementation that

    speeds up LLM inference. We validate that DejaVu can reduce the inference

    latency of OPT-175B by over 2X compared to the state-of-the-art

    FasterTransformer, and over 6X compared to the widely used Hugging Face

    times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art

    quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do

    not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work,

    we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human

    together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes

    only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it

    automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable

    human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize

    the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g.

    cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model.

    Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the

    artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly

    optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of

    individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose

    synthesis of human and novel view synthesis of both the human and the scene. We

  abstract: 'Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in
    deep

    learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its

    core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear

    attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space

    models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers'' computational

    inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as

    attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key

    weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning,

    and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be

    functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities,

    allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the

    sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though

    this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a

    hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these

    selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without

    attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\times$

    higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and

    its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a

    general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance

    across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language

    modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and

  abstract: 'Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often

    overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the

    source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on

    byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased

    use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have

    been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit

    tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and

    3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical

    reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and

    right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left

    tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to

    largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using

    standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns,

    suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We

    show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus

    allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on

    left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization

    directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger

    models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias.

    In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization

    choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks,

    accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work

    inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related

    choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning.'

  abstract: 'The BigCode project, an open-scientific collaboration focused on the

    responsible development of Large Language Models for Code (Code LLMs),

    introduces StarCoder2. In partnership with Software Heritage (SWH), we build

    The Stack v2 on top of the digital commons of their source code archive.

    Alongside the SWH repositories spanning 619 programming languages, we carefully

    select other high-quality data sources, such as GitHub pull requests, Kaggle

    notebooks, and code documentation. This results in a training set that is 4x

    larger than the first StarCoder dataset. We train StarCoder2 models with 3B,

    7B, and 15B parameters on 3.3 to 4.3 trillion tokens and thoroughly evaluate

    them on a comprehensive set of Code LLM benchmarks. We find that our small

    model, StarCoder2-3B, outperforms other Code LLMs of similar size on most

    benchmarks, and also outperforms StarCoderBase-15B. Our large model,

    StarCoder2- 15B, significantly outperforms other models of comparable size. In

    addition, it matches or outperforms CodeLlama-34B, a model more than twice its

    size. Although DeepSeekCoder- 33B is the best-performing model at code

    completion for high-resource languages, we find that StarCoder2-15B outperforms

    it on math and code reasoning benchmarks, as well as several low-resource

    languages. We make the model weights available under an OpenRAIL license and

    ensure full transparency regarding the training data by releasing the SoftWare

    Heritage persistent IDentifiers (SWHIDs) of the source code data.'

    concrete images from natural scenes. However, their ability to interpret

    abstract figures, such as geometry shapes and scientific plots, remains limited

    due to a scarcity of training datasets in scientific domains. To fill this gap,

    we introduce Multimodal ArXiv, consisting of ArXivCap and ArXivQA, for

    enhancing LVLMs scientific comprehension. ArXivCap is a figure-caption dataset

    comprising 6.4M images and 3.9M captions, sourced from 572K ArXiv papers

    spanning various scientific domains. Drawing from ArXivCap, we introduce

    ArXivQA, a question-answering dataset generated by prompting GPT-4V based on

    scientific figures. ArXivQA greatly enhances open-sourced LVLMs'' mathematical

    reasoning capabilities, achieving a 10.4\% absolute accuracy gain on a

    multimodal mathematical reasoning benchmark. Furthermore, employing ArXivCap,

    we devise four vision-to-text tasks for benchmarking LVLMs. Evaluation results

    with state-of-the-art LVLMs underscore their struggle with the nuanced

    semantics of academic figures, while domain-specific training yields

    substantial performance gains. Our error analysis uncovers misinterpretations

    of visual context, recognition errors, and the production of overly simplified

    captions by current LVLMs, shedding light on future improvements.'

  abstract: 'In this study, we introduce a methodology for human image animation by

    leveraging a 3D human parametric model within a latent diffusion framework to

    enhance shape alignment and motion guidance in curernt human generative

    techniques. The methodology utilizes the SMPL(Skinned Multi-Person Linear)

    model as the 3D human parametric model to establish a unified representation of

    body shape and pose. This facilitates the accurate capture of intricate human

    geometry and motion characteristics from source videos. Specifically, we

    incorporate rendered depth images, normal maps, and semantic maps obtained from

    SMPL sequences, alongside skeleton-based motion guidance, to enrich the

    conditions to the latent diffusion model with comprehensive 3D shape and

    detailed pose attributes. A multi-layer motion fusion module, integrating

    self-attention mechanisms, is employed to fuse the shape and motion latent

    representations in the spatial domain. By representing the 3D human parametric

    model as the motion guidance, we can perform parametric shape alignment of the

    human body between the reference image and the source video motion.

    Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the

    methodology''s superior ability to generate high-quality human animations that

    accurately capture both pose and shape variations. Furthermore, our approach

    also exhibits superior generalization capabilities on the proposed in-the-wild

    including Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and DeepSeekMoE. MLA guarantees

    efficient inference through significantly compressing the Key-Value (KV) cache

    into a latent vector, while DeepSeekMoE enables training strong models at an

    DeepSeek-V2 achieves significantly stronger performance, and meanwhile saves

    42.5% of training costs, reduces the KV cache by 93.3%, and boosts the maximum

    generation throughput to 5.76 times. We pretrain DeepSeek-V2 on a high-quality

    and multi-source corpus consisting of 8.1T tokens, and further perform

    Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to fully unlock

    minimize the impact on other legal adaptations. Experiment results in multiple

    female}) as directions in representation space. However, many natural concepts

    do not have natural contrasts (e.g., whether the output is about an animal). In

    this work, we show how to extend the formalization of the linear representation

    hypothesis to represent features (e.g., is_animal) as vectors. This allows us

    to immediately formalize the representation of categorical concepts as

    polytopes in the representation space. Further, we use the formalization to

    prove a relationship between the hierarchical structure of concepts and the

    geometry of their representations. We validate these theoretical results on the

    Gemma and LLaMA-3 large language models, estimating representations for 900+

    hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.'

  abstract: 'While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often

    attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from

    data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain

    elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing

    lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that

    transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how

    unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine

    the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to

    influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that

    constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and

    function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with

    multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with

    piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature

    learning only occurs from balanced initializations, where all layers learn at

    similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that

    promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through

    a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime

    drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes

    interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of

    learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular

    arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced

    initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.'

    high-quality images from text conditions. However, when facing multi-modal

    conditions, such as text combined with reference appearances, existing methods

    struggle to balance multiple conditions effectively, typically showing a

    preference for one modality over others. To address this challenge, we

    introduce EMMA, a novel image generation model accepting multi-modal prompts

    built upon the state-of-the-art text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model, ELLA. EMMA

    seamlessly incorporates additional modalities alongside text to guide image

    generation through an innovative Multi-modal Feature Connector design, which

    effectively integrates textual and supplementary modal information using a

    special attention mechanism. By freezing all parameters in the original T2I

    diffusion model and only adjusting some additional layers, we reveal an

    interesting finding that the pre-trained T2I diffusion model can secretly

    accept multi-modal prompts. This interesting property facilitates easy

    adaptation to different existing frameworks, making EMMA a flexible and

    effective tool for producing personalized and context-aware images and even

    videos. Additionally, we introduce a strategy to assemble learned EMMA modules

    to produce images conditioned on multiple modalities simultaneously,

    eliminating the need for additional training with mixed multi-modal prompts.

    Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EMMA in maintaining high

  abstract: 'The model editing problem concerns how language models should learn new
    facts

    about the world over time. While empirical research on model editing has drawn

    widespread attention, the conceptual foundations of model editing remain shaky

    -- perhaps unsurprisingly, since model editing is essentially belief revision,

    a storied problem in philosophy that has eluded succinct solutions for decades.

    Model editing nonetheless demands a solution, since we need to be able to

    control the knowledge within language models. With this goal in mind, this

    paper critiques the standard formulation of the model editing problem and

    proposes a formal testbed for model editing research. We first describe 12 open

    problems with model editing, based on challenges with (1) defining the problem,

    (2) developing benchmarks, and (3) assuming LLMs have editable beliefs in the

    first place. Many of these challenges are extremely difficult to address, e.g.

    determining far-reaching consequences of edits, labeling probabilistic

    entailments between facts, and updating beliefs of agent simulators. Next, we

    introduce a semi-synthetic dataset for model editing based on Wikidata, where

    we can evaluate edits against labels given by an idealized Bayesian agent. This

    enables us to say exactly how belief revision in language models falls short of

    a desirable epistemic standard. We encourage further research exploring

    settings where such a gold standard can be compared against. Our code is

  abstract: 'Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation
    is

    a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can

    operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of

    inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if

    an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time

    compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?

    Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance

    of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff

    inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little

    research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time

    inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for

    a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms

    to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based

    verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model''s distribution over a

    response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,

    the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute

    critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation

    motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most

    effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this

    compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute

    scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a

    FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model

    attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to

    outperform a 14x larger model.'

  abstract: 'Mass transport problems arise in many areas of machine learning whereby
    one

    wants to compute a map transporting one distribution to another. Generative

    modeling techniques like Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising

    Diffusion Models (DDMs) have been successfully adapted to solve such transport

    problems, resulting in CycleGAN and Bridge Matching respectively. However,

    these methods do not approximate Optimal Transport (OT) maps, which are known

    to have desirable properties. Existing techniques approximating OT maps for

    high-dimensional data-rich problems, such as DDM-based Rectified Flow and

    Schr\"odinger Bridge procedures, require fully training a DDM-type model at

    each iteration, or use mini-batch techniques which can introduce significant

    errors. We propose a novel algorithm to compute the Schr\"odinger Bridge, a

    dynamic entropy-regularised version of OT, that eliminates the need to train

    multiple DDM-like models. This algorithm corresponds to a discretisation of a

    flow of path measures, which we call the Schr\"odinger Bridge Flow, whose only

    stationary point is the Schr\"odinger Bridge. We demonstrate the performance of

    our algorithm on a variety of unpaired data translation tasks.'

    neural

    networks, presenting a critical need for more efficient alternatives. Previous

    efforts focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices and

    neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in

    terms of compute-optimal scaling laws when both the model size and training

    examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework

    that enables searching among all linear operators expressible via an Einstein

    summation. This framework encompasses many previously proposed structures, such

    as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, Block Tensor-Train (BTT), and Monarch,

    along with many novel structures. To analyze the framework, we develop a

    taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic

    properties and show that differences in the compute-optimal scaling laws are

    mostly governed by a small number of variables that we introduce. Namely, a

    small $\omega$ (which measures parameter sharing) and large $\psi$ (which

    measures the rank) reliably led to better scaling laws. Guided by the insight

    that full-rank structures that maximize parameters per unit of compute perform

    the best, we propose BTT-MoE, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture

    obtained by sparsifying computation in the BTT structure. In contrast to the

    standard sparse MoE for each entire feed-forward network, BTT-MoE learns an MoE

    in every single linear layer of the model, including the projection matrices in

    the attention blocks. We find BTT-MoE provides a substantial compute-efficiency

    gain over dense layers and standard MoE.'

    high spatial compression ratios (e.g., 64x). We address this challenge by

    introducing two key techniques: (1) Residual Autoencoding, where we design our

    alleviate the optimization difficulty of high spatial-compression autoencoders;

    (2) Decoupled High-Resolution Adaptation, an efficient decoupled three-phases

  abstract: 'Bayes'' rule naturally allows for inference refinement in a streaming
    fashion,

    without the need to recompute posteriors from scratch whenever new data

    arrives. In principle, Bayesian streaming is straightforward: we update our

    prior with the available data and use the resulting posterior as a prior when

    processing the next data chunk. In practice, however, this recipe entails i)

    approximating an intractable posterior at each time step; and ii) encapsulating

    results appropriately to allow for posterior propagation. For continuous state

    spaces, variational inference (VI) is particularly convenient due to its

    scalability and the tractability of variational posteriors. For discrete state

    spaces, however, state-of-the-art VI results in analytically intractable

    approximations that are ill-suited for streaming settings. To enable streaming

    Bayesian inference over discrete parameter spaces, we propose streaming Bayes

    GFlowNets (abbreviated as SB-GFlowNets) by leveraging the recently proposed

    GFlowNets -- a powerful class of amortized samplers for discrete compositional

    objects. Notably, SB-GFlowNet approximates the initial posterior using a

    standard GFlowNet and subsequently updates it using a tailored procedure that

    requires only the newly observed data. Our case studies in linear preference

    learning and phylogenetic inference showcase the effectiveness of SB-GFlowNets

    in sampling from an unnormalized posterior in a streaming setting. As expected,

    we also observe that SB-GFlowNets is significantly faster than repeatedly

    training a GFlowNet from scratch to sample from the full posterior.'

    or an

    inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed

    2022] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of

    Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [Chen et al.,

    2013]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in

    modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure:

    a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label

    hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a

    simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based

    representation loss along with a centering loss, and can be combined with any

    standard task loss to learn hierarchy-informed features. Extensive experiments

    HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance

    especially under low dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of

  abstract: 'Language models (LMs), like other neural networks, often favor shortcut

    heuristics based on surface-level patterns. Although LMs behave like n-gram

    models early in training, they must eventually learn hierarchical syntactic

    representations to correctly apply grammatical rules out-of-distribution (OOD).

    In this work, we use case studies of English grammar to explore how complex,

    diverse training data drives models to generalize OOD. We construct a framework

    that unifies our understanding of random variation with training dynamics, rule

    selection with memorization, and data diversity with complexity. We show that

    these factors are nuanced, and that intermediate levels of diversity and

    complexity lead to inconsistent behavior across random seeds and to unstable

    training dynamics. Our findings emphasize the critical role of training data in

    shaping generalization patterns and illuminate how competing model strategies

    lead to inconsistent generalization outcomes across random seeds. Code is

  abstract: "LLMs have revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and have\n\
    emerged as the de-facto tool for many tasks. The current established technology\n\
    of LLMs is to process input and generate output at the token level. This is in\n\
    sharp contrast to humans who operate at multiple levels of abstraction, well\n\
    beyond single words, to analyze information and to generate creative content.\n\
    In this paper, we present an attempt at an architecture which operates on an\n\
    explicit higher-level semantic representation, which we name a concept.\nConcepts\
    \ are language- and modality-agnostic and represent a higher level idea\nor action\
    \ in a flow. Hence, we build a \"Large Concept Model\". In this study, as\nproof\
    \ of feasibility, we assume that a concept corresponds to a sentence, and\nuse\
    \ an existing sentence embedding space, SONAR, which supports up to 200\nlanguages\
    \ in both text and speech modalities.\n  The Large Concept Model is trained to\
    \ perform autoregressive sentence\nprediction in an embedding space. We explore\
    \ multiple approaches, namely MSE\nregression, variants of diffusion-based generation,\
    \ and models operating in a\nquantized SONAR space. These explorations are performed\
    \ using 1.6B parameter\nmodels and training data in the order of 1.3T tokens.\
    \ We then scale one\narchitecture to a model size of 7B parameters and training\
    \ data of about 2.7T\ntokens. We perform an experimental evaluation on several\
    \ generative tasks,\nnamely summarization and a new task of summary expansion.\
    \ Finally, we show that\nour model exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization\
    \ performance to many\nlanguages, outperforming existing LLMs of the same size.\
    \ The training code of\nour models is freely available."

  abstract: 'Controllable human image animation aims to generate videos from reference

    images using driving videos. Due to the limited control signals provided by

    sparse guidance (e.g., skeleton pose), recent works have attempted to introduce

    additional dense conditions (e.g., depth map) to ensure motion alignment.

    However, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video

    when the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that

    of the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more

    generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input,

    which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into

    motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a

    dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which

    provides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of

    the sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to

    pose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are

    transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To

    seamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid

    ControlNet that improves the quality and consistency of generated videos while

    freezing the existing model parameters. Extensive qualitative and quantitative

    experiments demonstrate the superiority of DisPose compared to current methods.

  abstract: 'Learning to understand dynamic 3D scenes from imagery is crucial for

    applications ranging from robotics to scene reconstruction. Yet, unlike other

    problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress,

    directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due

    to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present

    a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic,

    wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose

    estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into

    high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate

    large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds

    with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by

    training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world

    image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables

    generalization to diverse real-world scenes. Project page:

  abstract: 'Modeling human behavior is essential to accurately predict epidemic spread,

    with behaviors like vaccine hesitancy complicating control efforts. While

    epidemic spread is often treated as a simple contagion, vaccine uptake may

    follow complex contagion dynamics, where individuals'' decisions depend on

    multiple social contacts. Recently, the concept of complex contagion has

    received strong theoretical underpinnings thanks to the generalization of

    spreading phenomena from pairwise to higher-order interactions. Although

    several potential applications have been suggested, examples of complex

    contagions motivated by real data remain scarce. Surveys on COVID-19 vaccine

    hesitancy in the US suggest that vaccination attitudes may indeed depend on the

    vaccination status of social peers, aligning with complex contagion principles.

    In this work, we examine the interactions between epidemic spread, vaccination,

    and vaccine uptake attitudes under complex contagion. Using the SIR model with

    a dynamic, threshold-based vaccination campaign, we simulate scenarios on an

    age-structured multilayer network informed by US contact data. Our results

    offer insights into the role of social dynamics in shaping vaccination behavior

    and epidemic outcomes.'

  abstract: 'In this work, we question the necessity of adaptive gradient methods
    for

    training deep neural networks. SGD-SaI is a simple yet effective enhancement to

    stochastic gradient descent with momentum (SGDM). SGD-SaI performs learning

    rate Scaling at Initialization (SaI) to distinct parameter groups, guided by

    their respective gradient signal-to-noise ratios (g-SNR). By adjusting learning

    rates without relying on adaptive second-order momentum, SGD-SaI helps prevent

    training imbalances from the very first iteration and cuts the optimizer''s

    memory usage by half compared to AdamW. Despite its simplicity and efficiency,

    SGD-SaI consistently matches or outperforms AdamW in training a variety of

    Transformer-based tasks, effectively overcoming a long-standing challenge of

    using SGD for training Transformers. SGD-SaI excels in ImageNet-1K

    classification with Vision Transformers(ViT) and GPT-2 pretraining for large

    language models (LLMs, transformer decoder-only), demonstrating robustness to

    hyperparameter variations and practicality for diverse applications. We further

    tested its robustness on tasks like LoRA fine-tuning for LLMs and diffusion

    models, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art optimizers. From a

    memory efficiency perspective, SGD-SaI achieves substantial memory savings for

    optimizer states, reducing memory usage by 5.93 GB for GPT-2 (1.5B parameters)

    and 25.15 GB for Llama2-7B compared to AdamW in full-precision training

  abstract: 'With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein

    discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces

    promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has

    not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to

    alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and

    trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This

    paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this

    opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated

    Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target

    phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended

    novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse

    simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a

    diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life,

    Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential

    of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids

    lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway''s Game

    of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of

    previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm
