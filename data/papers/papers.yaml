  abstract: 'A very simple way to improve the performance of almost any machine learning

    algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to

    average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole

    ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to

    allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual

    models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it

    is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which

    is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different

    compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show

    that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used

    commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a

    single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more

    full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained

    classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these

    specialist models can be trained rapidly and in parallel.'

  abstract: 'A central problem in machine learning involves modeling complex data-sets

    using highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning,

    sampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally

    tractable. Here, we develop an approach that simultaneously achieves both

    flexibility and tractability. The essential idea, inspired by non-equilibrium

    statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a

    data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn

    a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly

    flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to

    rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative

    models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute

    conditional and posterior probabilities under the learned model. We

    additionally release an open source reference implementation of the algorithm.'

    autonomous vehicles. There is a great need for new reinforcement learning

    methods that can efficiently learn decentralised policies for such systems. To

    this end, we propose a new multi-agent actor-critic method called

    counterfactual multi-agent (COMA) policy gradients. COMA uses a centralised

    critic to estimate the Q-function and decentralised actors to optimise the

    agents'' policies. In addition, to address the challenges of multi-agent credit

    assignment, it uses a counterfactual baseline that marginalises out a single

    agent''s action, while keeping the other agents'' actions fixed. COMA also uses
    a

    critic representation that allows the counterfactual baseline to be computed

    efficiently in a single forward pass. We evaluate COMA in the testbed of

    StarCraft unit micromanagement, using a decentralised variant with significant

    partial observability. COMA significantly improves average performance over

    other multi-agent actor-critic methods in this setting, and the best performing

  abstract: 'Optimal transport (OT) theory can be informally described using the words
    of

    the French mathematician Gaspard Monge (1746-1818): A worker with a shovel in

    hand has to move a large pile of sand lying on a construction site. The goal of

    the worker is to erect with all that sand a target pile with a prescribed shape

    (for example, that of a giant sand castle). Naturally, the worker wishes to

    minimize her total effort, quantified for instance as the total distance or

    time spent carrying shovelfuls of sand. Mathematicians interested in OT cast

    that problem as that of comparing two probability distributions, two different

    piles of sand of the same volume. They consider all of the many possible ways

    to morph, transport or reshape the first pile into the second, and associate a

    "global" cost to every such transport, using the "local" consideration of how

    much it costs to move a grain of sand from one place to another. Recent years

    have witnessed the spread of OT in several fields, thanks to the emergence of

    approximate solvers that can scale to sizes and dimensions that are relevant to

    data sciences. Thanks to this newfound scalability, OT is being increasingly

    used to unlock various problems in imaging sciences (such as color or texture

    processing), computer vision and graphics (for shape manipulation) or machine

    learning (for regression, classification and density fitting). This short book

    reviews OT with a bias toward numerical methods and their applications in data

    sciences, and sheds lights on the theoretical properties of OT that make it

    particularly useful for some of these applications.'

  abstract: 'Many recently trained neural networks employ large numbers of parameters
    to

    achieve good performance. One may intuitively use the number of parameters

    required as a rough gauge of the difficulty of a problem. But how accurate are

    such notions? How many parameters are really needed? In this paper we attempt

    to answer this question by training networks not in their native parameter

    space, but instead in a smaller, randomly oriented subspace. We slowly increase

    the dimension of this subspace, note at which dimension solutions first appear,

    and define this to be the intrinsic dimension of the objective landscape. The

    approach is simple to implement, computationally tractable, and produces

    several suggestive conclusions. Many problems have smaller intrinsic dimensions

    than one might suspect, and the intrinsic dimension for a given dataset varies

    little across a family of models with vastly different sizes. This latter

    result has the profound implication that once a parameter space is large enough

    to solve a problem, extra parameters serve directly to increase the

    dimensionality of the solution manifold. Intrinsic dimension allows some

    quantitative comparison of problem difficulty across supervised, reinforcement,

    and other types of learning where we conclude, for example, that solving the

    inverted pendulum problem is 100 times easier than classifying digits from

    MNIST, and playing Atari Pong from pixels is about as hard as classifying

    CIFAR-10. In addition to providing new cartography of the objective landscapes

    wandered by parameterized models, the method is a simple technique for

    constructively obtaining an upper bound on the minimum description length of a

    solution. A byproduct of this construction is a simple approach for compressing

    networks, in some cases by more than 100 times.'

    one of

    the most important tasks in the machine learning field, especially with layered

    neural networks, which have achieved high predictive performance with various

    practical data sets. To reveal the global structure of a trained neural network

    in an interpretable way, a series of clustering methods have been proposed,

    which decompose the units into clusters according to the similarity of their

    inference roles. The main problems in these studies were that (1) we have no

    prior knowledge about the optimal resolution for the decomposition, or the

    appropriate number of clusters, and (2) there was no method with which to

    acquire knowledge about whether the outputs of each cluster have a positive or

    negative correlation with the input and output dimension values. In this paper,

    to solve these problems, we propose a method for obtaining a hierarchical

    improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep

    learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the

    bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also

    perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations

    for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn

    distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically

    well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep

    ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible

    explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable

    variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep

    ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this

    hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of

    neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of

    functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random

    initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an

    optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a

    single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight

    space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that

    the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular

    subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of

    ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and

    the experimental results validate our hypothesis.'

    transposed convolution (upscaling). Such operations are limited to a fixed

    filter moving at predetermined integer steps (strides). Spatial sizes of

    consecutive layers are related by integer scale factors, predetermined at

    architectural design, and remain fixed throughout training and inference time.

    We propose a generalization of the common Conv-layer, from a discrete layer to

    a Continuous Convolution (CC) Layer. CC Layers naturally extend Conv-layers by

    representing the filter as a learned continuous function over sub-pixel

    coordinates. This allows learnable and principled resizing of feature maps, to

    any size, dynamically and consistently across scales. Once trained, the CC

    layer can be used to output any scale/size chosen at inference time. The scale

    can be non-integer and differ between the axes. CC gives rise to new freedoms

    for architectural design, such as dynamic layer shapes at inference time, or

    gradual architectures where the size changes by a small factor at each layer.

    This gives rise to many desired CNN properties, new architectural design

    capabilities, and useful applications. We further show that current Conv-layers

    suffer from inherent misalignments, which are ameliorated by CC layers.'

  abstract: 'In suitably initialized wide networks, small learning rates transform
    deep

    neural networks (DNNs) into neural tangent kernel (NTK) machines, whose

    training dynamics is well-approximated by a linear weight expansion of the

    network at initialization. Standard training, however, diverges from its

    linearization in ways that are poorly understood. We study the relationship

    between the training dynamics of nonlinear deep networks, the geometry of the

    loss landscape, and the time evolution of a data-dependent NTK. We do so

    through a large-scale phenomenological analysis of training, synthesizing

    diverse measures characterizing loss landscape geometry and NTK dynamics. In

    multiple neural architectures and datasets, we find these diverse measures

    evolve in a highly correlated manner, revealing a universal picture of the deep

    learning process. In this picture, deep network training exhibits a highly

    chaotic rapid initial transient that within 2 to 3 epochs determines the final

    linearly connected basin of low loss containing the end point of training.

    During this chaotic transient, the NTK changes rapidly, learning useful

    features from the training data that enables it to outperform the standard

    initial NTK by a factor of 3 in less than 3 to 4 epochs. After this rapid

    chaotic transient, the NTK changes at constant velocity, and its performance

    matches that of full network training in 15% to 45% of training time. Overall,

    our analysis reveals a striking correlation between a diverse set of metrics

    over training time, governed by a rapid chaotic to stable transition in the

    first few epochs, that together poses challenges and opportunities for the

    development of more accurate theories of deep learning.'

  abstract: 'Although pretrained language models can be fine-tuned to produce

    state-of-the-art results for a very wide range of language understanding tasks,

    the dynamics of this process are not well understood, especially in the low

    data regime. Why can we use relatively vanilla gradient descent algorithms

    (e.g., without strong regularization) to tune a model with hundreds of millions

    of parameters on datasets with only hundreds or thousands of labeled examples?

    In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of

    intrinsic dimension provides us with empirical and theoretical intuitions to

    explain this remarkable phenomenon. We empirically show that common pre-trained

    models have a very low intrinsic dimension; in other words, there exists a low

    dimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full

    parameter space. For example, by optimizing only 200 trainable parameters

    randomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to

    achieve 90\% of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we

    empirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension

    and, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension

    after a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their

    extreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low

    dimensional task representations and compression based generalization bounds to

    provide intrinsic-dimension-based generalization bounds that are independent of

    the full parameter count.'

  abstract: 'Adapting large-scale pretrained language models to downstream tasks via

    fine-tuning is the standard method for achieving state-of-the-art performance

    on NLP benchmarks. However, fine-tuning all weights of models with millions or

    billions of parameters is sample-inefficient, unstable in low-resource

    settings, and wasteful as it requires storing a separate copy of the model for

    each task. Recent work has developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods,

    but these approaches either still require a relatively large number of

    parameters or underperform standard fine-tuning. In this work, we propose

    Compacter, a method for fine-tuning large-scale language models with a better

    trade-off between task performance and the number of trainable parameters than

    prior work. Compacter accomplishes this by building on top of ideas from

    adapters, low-rank optimization, and parameterized hypercomplex multiplication

    layers. Specifically, Compacter inserts task-specific weight matrices into a

    pretrained model''s weights, which are computed efficiently as a sum of

    Kronecker products between shared "slow" weights and "fast" rank-one matrices

    defined per Compacter layer. By only training 0.047% of a pretrained model''s

    parameters, Compacter performs on par with standard fine-tuning on GLUE and

    outperforms standard fine-tuning on SuperGLUE and low-resource settings. Our

  abstract: 'At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are
    not

    well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that

    training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to

    gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple

    weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced

    by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on
    a

    regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when

    training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the

    models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the

    weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained

    Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in

    their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression

    problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context

    learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore

    identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by

    learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data

    representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss

    intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context

    learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be

    understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent

    learning within Transformers. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at

    to develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring

    negative interference and that generalise systematically to non-identically

    distributed tasks. Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to

    these challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented

    as autonomous parameter-efficient modules. Information is conditionally routed

    to a subset of modules and subsequently aggregated. These properties enable

    positive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from

    routing and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular

    architectures, providing a unified view over several threads of research that

    evolved independently in the scientific literature. Moreover, we explore

    various additional purposes of modularity, including scaling language models,

    causal inference, programme induction, and planning in reinforcement learning.

    Finally, we report various concrete applications where modularity has been

    a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable

    diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can

    counteract the effectiveness of the data-protecting perturbations. We

    rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of

    required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting

    perturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-of-the-art

    performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various

    scenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch

    between the diffusion model and the protected data. Our findings call for more

    research into making personal data unexploitable, showing that this goal is far

  abstract: 'Inversion by Direct Iteration (InDI) is a new formulation for supervised

    image restoration that avoids the so-called "regression to the mean" effect and

    produces more realistic and detailed images than existing regression-based

    methods. It does this by gradually improving image quality in small steps,

    similar to generative denoising diffusion models. Image restoration is an

    ill-posed problem where multiple high-quality images are plausible

    reconstructions of a given low-quality input. Therefore, the outcome of a

    single step regression model is typically an aggregate of all possible

    explanations, therefore lacking details and realism. The main advantage of InDI

    is that it does not try to predict the clean target image in a single step but

    instead gradually improves the image in small steps, resulting in better

    perceptual quality. While generative denoising diffusion models also work in

    small steps, our formulation is distinct in that it does not require knowledge

    of any analytic form of the degradation process. Instead, we directly learn an

    iterative restoration process from low-quality and high-quality paired

    examples. InDI can be applied to virtually any image degradation, given paired

    training data. In conditional denoising diffusion image restoration the

    denoising network generates the restored image by repeatedly denoising an

    initial image of pure noise, conditioned on the degraded input. Contrary to

    conditional denoising formulations, InDI directly proceeds by iteratively

    restoring the input low-quality image, producing high-quality results on a

    variety of image restoration tasks, including motion and out-of-focus

    deblurring, super-resolution, compression artifact removal, and denoising.'

  abstract: 'Recent work claims that large language models display emergent abilities,

    abilities not present in smaller-scale models that are present in larger-scale

    models. What makes emergent abilities intriguing is two-fold: their sharpness,

    transitioning seemingly instantaneously from not present to present, and their

    unpredictability, appearing at seemingly unforeseeable model scales. Here, we

    present an alternative explanation for emergent abilities: that for a

    particular task and model family, when analyzing fixed model outputs, emergent

    abilities appear due to the researcher''s choice of metric rather than due to

    fundamental changes in model behavior with scale. Specifically, nonlinear or

    discontinuous metrics produce apparent emergent abilities, whereas linear or

    continuous metrics produce smooth, continuous predictable changes in model

    performance. We present our alternative explanation in a simple mathematical

    model, then test it in three complementary ways: we (1) make, test and confirm

    three predictions on the effect of metric choice using the InstructGPT/GPT-3

    family on tasks with claimed emergent abilities; (2) make, test and confirm two

    predictions about metric choices in a meta-analysis of emergent abilities on

    BIG-Bench; and (3) show to choose metrics to produce never-before-seen

    seemingly emergent abilities in multiple vision tasks across diverse deep

    networks. Via all three analyses, we provide evidence that alleged emergent

    abilities evaporate with different metrics or with better statistics, and may

    not be a fundamental property of scaling AI models.'

  abstract: "Recent years have witnessed success in AIGC (AI Generated Content). People\n\
    can make use of a pre-trained diffusion model to generate images of high\nquality\
    \ or freely modify existing pictures with only prompts in nature\nlanguage. More\
    \ excitingly, the emerging personalization techniques make it\nfeasible to create\
    \ specific-desired images with only a few images as\nreferences. However, this\
    \ induces severe threats if such advanced techniques\nare misused by malicious\
    \ users, such as spreading fake news or defaming\nindividual reputations. Thus,\
    \ it is necessary to regulate personalization\nmodels (i.e., concept censorship)\
    \ for their development and advancement.\n  In this paper, we focus on the personalization\
    \ technique dubbed Textual\nInversion (TI), which is becoming prevailing for its\
    \ lightweight nature and\nexcellent performance. TI crafts the word embedding\
    \ that contains detailed\ninformation about a specific object. Users can easily\
    \ download the word\nembedding from public websites like Civitai and add it to\
    \ their own stable\ndiffusion model without fine-tuning for personalization. To\
    \ achieve the concept\ncensorship of a TI model, we propose leveraging the backdoor\
    \ technique for good\nby injecting backdoors into the Textual Inversion embeddings.\
    \ Briefly, we\nselect some sensitive words as triggers during the training of\
    \ TI, which will\nbe censored for normal use. In the subsequent generation stage,\
    \ if the triggers\nare combined with personalized embeddings as final prompts,\
    \ the model will\noutput a pre-defined target image rather than images including\
    \ the desired\nmalicious concept.\n  To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach,\
    \ we conduct extensive\nexperiments on Stable Diffusion, a prevailing open-sourced\

  abstract: 'Many areas of machine learning and science involve large linear algebra

    problems, such as eigendecompositions, solving linear systems, computing matrix

    exponentials, and trace estimation. The matrices involved often have Kronecker,

    convolutional, block diagonal, sum, or product structure. In this paper, we

    propose a simple but general framework for large-scale linear algebra problems

    in machine learning, named CoLA (Compositional Linear Algebra). By combining a

    linear operator abstraction with compositional dispatch rules, CoLA

    automatically constructs memory and runtime efficient numerical algorithms.

    Moreover, CoLA provides memory efficient automatic differentiation, low

    precision computation, and GPU acceleration in both JAX and PyTorch, while also

    accommodating new objects, operations, and rules in downstream packages via

    multiple dispatch. CoLA can accelerate many algebraic operations, while making

    it easy to prototype matrix structures and algorithms, providing an appealing

    drop-in tool for virtually any computational effort that requires linear

    algebra. We showcase its efficacy across a broad range of applications,

    including partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, equivariant model

    construction, and unsupervised learning.'

  abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have been applied in various applications
    due to

    chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and in-context learning (ICL), the prompts fed

    LLMLingua, a coarse-to-fine prompt compression method that involves a budget

    controller to maintain semantic integrity under high compression ratios, a

    token-level iterative compression algorithm to better model the interdependence

    between compressed contents, and an instruction tuning based method for

    distribution alignment between language models. We conduct experiments and

    analysis over four datasets from different scenarios, i.e., GSM8K, BBH,

    ShareGPT, and Arxiv-March23; showing that the proposed approach yields

    state-of-the-art performance and allows for up to 20x compression with little

  abstract: 'Tokenization, the division of input text into input tokens, is an often

    overlooked aspect of the large language model (LLM) pipeline and could be the

    source of useful or harmful inductive biases. Historically, LLMs have relied on

    byte pair encoding, without care to specific input domains. With the increased

    use of LLMs for reasoning, various number-specific tokenization schemes have

    been adopted, with popular models like LLaMa and PaLM opting for single-digit

    tokenization while GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 have separate tokens for each 1-, 2-, and

    3-digit numbers. In this work, we study the effect this choice has on numerical

    reasoning through the use of arithmetic tasks. We consider left-to-right and

    right-to-left tokenization for GPT-3.5 and -4, finding that right-to-left

    tokenization (enforced by comma separating numbers at inference time) leads to

    largely improved performance. Furthermore, we find that model errors when using

    standard left-to-right tokenization follow stereotyped error patterns,

    suggesting that model computations are systematic rather than approximate. We

    show that the model is able to convert between tokenizations easily, thus

    allowing chain-of-thought-inspired approaches to recover performance on

    left-to-right tokenized inputs. We also find the gap between tokenization

    directions decreases when models are scaled, possibly indicating that larger

    models are better able to override this tokenization-dependent inductive bias.

    In summary, our work performs the first study of how number tokenization

    choices lead to differences in model performance on arithmetic tasks,

    accompanied by a thorough analysis of error patterns. We hope this work

    inspires practitioners to more carefully ablate number tokenization-related

    choices when working towards general models of numerical reasoning.'

  abstract: 'In this study, we introduce a methodology for human image animation by

    leveraging a 3D human parametric model within a latent diffusion framework to

    enhance shape alignment and motion guidance in curernt human generative

    techniques. The methodology utilizes the SMPL(Skinned Multi-Person Linear)

    model as the 3D human parametric model to establish a unified representation of

    body shape and pose. This facilitates the accurate capture of intricate human

    geometry and motion characteristics from source videos. Specifically, we

    incorporate rendered depth images, normal maps, and semantic maps obtained from

    SMPL sequences, alongside skeleton-based motion guidance, to enrich the

    conditions to the latent diffusion model with comprehensive 3D shape and

    detailed pose attributes. A multi-layer motion fusion module, integrating

    self-attention mechanisms, is employed to fuse the shape and motion latent

    representations in the spatial domain. By representing the 3D human parametric

    model as the motion guidance, we can perform parametric shape alignment of the

    human body between the reference image and the source video motion.

    Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the

    methodology''s superior ability to generate high-quality human animations that

    accurately capture both pose and shape variations. Furthermore, our approach

    also exhibits superior generalization capabilities on the proposed in-the-wild

    to specific user preferences, but such adaptability has also been utilized for

    illegal purposes, such as forging public figures'' portraits, duplicating

    copyrighted artworks and generating explicit contents. Existing work focused on

    detecting the illegally generated contents, but cannot prevent or mitigate

    FreezeAsGuard, a new technique that addresses these limitations and enables

    irreversible mitigation of illegal adaptations of diffusion models. Our

    approach is that the model publisher selectively freezes tensors in pre-trained

    diffusion models that are critical to illegal model adaptations, to mitigate

    the fine-tuned model''s representation power in illegal adaptations, but

    minimize the impact on other legal adaptations. Experiment results in multiple

    power in mitigating illegal model adaptations compared to competitive

  abstract: 'While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often

    attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from

    data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain

    elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing

    lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that

    transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how

    unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine

    the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to

    influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that

    constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and

    function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with

    multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with

    piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature

    learning only occurs from balanced initializations, where all layers learn at

    similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that

    promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through

    a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime

    drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes

    interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of

    learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular

    arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced

    initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.'

  abstract: 'Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation

    models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous

    potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the

    success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we

    systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices.

    We show that different structures often require drastically different

    initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance,

    especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update

    Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and

    learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling

    laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves

    with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the

    Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for

    the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT

    achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and

    ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less

    compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language

  abstract: 'The model editing problem concerns how language models should learn new
    facts

    about the world over time. While empirical research on model editing has drawn

    widespread attention, the conceptual foundations of model editing remain shaky

    -- perhaps unsurprisingly, since model editing is essentially belief revision,

    a storied problem in philosophy that has eluded succinct solutions for decades.

    Model editing nonetheless demands a solution, since we need to be able to

    control the knowledge within language models. With this goal in mind, this

    paper critiques the standard formulation of the model editing problem and

    proposes a formal testbed for model editing research. We first describe 12 open

    problems with model editing, based on challenges with (1) defining the problem,

    (2) developing benchmarks, and (3) assuming LLMs have editable beliefs in the

    first place. Many of these challenges are extremely difficult to address, e.g.

    determining far-reaching consequences of edits, labeling probabilistic

    entailments between facts, and updating beliefs of agent simulators. Next, we

    introduce a semi-synthetic dataset for model editing based on Wikidata, where

    we can evaluate edits against labels given by an idealized Bayesian agent. This

    enables us to say exactly how belief revision in language models falls short of

    a desirable epistemic standard. We encourage further research exploring

    settings where such a gold standard can be compared against. Our code is

  abstract: 'Robust and effective scaling of models from small to large width typically

    requires the precise adjustment of many algorithmic and architectural details,

    such as parameterization and optimizer choices. In this work, we propose a new

    perspective on parameterization by investigating a key assumption in prior work

    about the alignment between parameters and data and derive new theoretical

    results under weaker assumptions and a broader set of optimizers. Our extensive

    empirical investigation includes tens of thousands of models trained with all

    combinations of three optimizers, four parameterizations, several alignment

    assumptions, more than a dozen learning rates, and fourteen model sizes up to

    26.8B parameters. We find that the best learning rate scaling prescription

    would often have been excluded by the assumptions in prior work. Our results

    show that all parameterizations, not just maximal update parameterization

    (muP), can achieve hyperparameter transfer; moreover, our novel per-layer

    learning rate prescription for standard parameterization outperforms muP.

    Finally, we demonstrate that an overlooked aspect of parameterization, the

    epsilon parameter in Adam, must be scaled correctly to avoid gradient underflow

    and propose Adam-atan2, a new numerically stable, scale-invariant version of

    Adam that eliminates the epsilon hyperparameter entirely.'

  abstract: 'Diffusion Models have emerged as powerful generative models for high-quality

    Previous works have attempted to safeguard images from diffusion-based editing

    by adding imperceptible perturbations. These methods are costly and

    specifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while

    Pixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust

    efforts focused on a small number of hand-crafted structured matrices and

    neglected to investigate whether these structures can surpass dense layers in

    examples are optimally allocated. In this work, we present a unifying framework

    as low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, Block Tensor-Train (BTT), and Monarch,

    along with many novel structures. To analyze the framework, we develop a

    taxonomy of all such operators based on their computational and algebraic

    properties and show that differences in the compute-optimal scaling laws are

    mostly governed by a small number of variables that we introduce. Namely, a

    small $\omega$ (which measures parameter sharing) and large $\psi$ (which

    measures the rank) reliably led to better scaling laws. Guided by the insight

    that full-rank structures that maximize parameters per unit of compute perform

    the best, we propose BTT-MoE, a novel Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture

    obtained by sparsifying computation in the BTT structure. In contrast to the

    standard sparse MoE for each entire feed-forward network, BTT-MoE learns an MoE

    in every single linear layer of the model, including the projection matrices in

    the attention blocks. We find BTT-MoE provides a substantial compute-efficiency

  abstract: 'Modern Question Answering (QA) and Reasoning approaches based on Large

    Language Models (LLMs) commonly use prompting techniques, such as

    Chain-of-Thought (CoT), assuming the resulting generation will have a more

    granular exploration and reasoning over the question space and scope. However,

    such methods struggle with generating outputs that are faithful to the

    intermediate chain of reasoning produced by the model. On the other end of the

    spectrum, neuro-symbolic methods such as Faithful CoT (F-CoT) propose to

    combine LLMs with external symbolic solvers. While such approaches boast a high

    degree of faithfulness, they usually require a model trained for code

    generation and struggle with tasks that are ambiguous or hard to formalise

    strictly. We introduce $\textbf{F}$aithful $\textbf{L}$ogic-$\textbf{A}$ided

    $\textbf{R}$easoning and $\textbf{E}$xploration ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel

    interpretable approach for traversing the problem space using task

    decompositions. We use the LLM to plan a solution, soft-formalise the query

    into facts and predicates using a logic programming code and simulate that code

    execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search over the defined space. Our

    method allows us to compute the faithfulness of the reasoning process w.r.t.

    the generated code and analyse the steps of the multi-hop search without

    relying on external solvers. Our methods achieve SOTA results on $\mathbf{7}$

    out of $\mathbf{9}$ diverse reasoning benchmarks. We also show that model

    faithfulness positively correlates with overall performance and further

    demonstrate that $\textbf{FLARE}$ allows pinpointing the decisive factors

    sufficient for and leading to the correct answer with optimal reasoning during

    the multi-hop search.'

  abstract: 'We present a method for computing free-energy differences using thermodynamic

    integration with a neural network potential that interpolates between two

    target Hamiltonians. The interpolation is defined at the sample distribution

    level, and the neural network potential is optimized to match the corresponding

    equilibrium potential at every intermediate time-step. Once the interpolating

    potentials and samples are well-aligned, the free-energy difference can be

    estimated using (neural) thermodynamic integration. To target molecular

    systems, we simultaneously couple Lennard-Jones and electrostatic interactions

    and model the rigid-body rotation of molecules. We report accurate results for

    several benchmark systems: a Lennard-Jones particle in a Lennard-Jones fluid,

    as well as the insertion of both water and methane solutes in a water solvent

  abstract: 'Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities, but
    still

    struggle with complex reasoning tasks requiring multiple steps. While

    prompt-based methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can improve LLM reasoning at

    inference time, optimizing reasoning capabilities during training remains

    challenging. We introduce LaTent Reasoning Optimization (LaTRO), a principled

    framework that formulates reasoning as sampling from a latent distribution and

    optimizes it via variational approaches. LaTRO enables LLMs to concurrently

    improve both their reasoning process and ability to evaluate reasoning quality,

    without requiring external feedback or reward models. We validate LaTRO through

    experiments on GSM8K and ARC-Challenge datasets using multiple model

    architectures. On GSM8K, LaTRO improves zero-shot accuracy by an average of

    12.5% over base models and 9.6% over supervised fine-tuning across

    Phi-3.5-mini, Mistral-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B. Our findings suggest that

    pre-trained LLMs possess latent reasoning capabilities that can be unlocked and

    enhanced through our proposed optimization approach in a self-improvement

    manner. The code of LaTRO is available at

  abstract: 'Language models (LMs), like other neural networks, often favor shortcut

    heuristics based on surface-level patterns. Although LMs behave like n-gram

    models early in training, they must eventually learn hierarchical syntactic

    representations to correctly apply grammatical rules out-of-distribution (OOD).

    In this work, we use case studies of English grammar to explore how complex,

    diverse training data drives models to generalize OOD. We construct a framework

    that unifies our understanding of random variation with training dynamics, rule

    selection with memorization, and data diversity with complexity. We show that

    these factors are nuanced, and that intermediate levels of diversity and

    complexity lead to inconsistent behavior across random seeds and to unstable

    training dynamics. Our findings emphasize the critical role of training data in

    shaping generalization patterns and illuminate how competing model strategies

    lead to inconsistent generalization outcomes across random seeds. Code is

  abstract: 'Controllable human image animation aims to generate videos from reference

    images using driving videos. Due to the limited control signals provided by

    sparse guidance (e.g., skeleton pose), recent works have attempted to introduce

    additional dense conditions (e.g., depth map) to ensure motion alignment.

    However, such strict dense guidance impairs the quality of the generated video

    when the body shape of the reference character differs significantly from that

    of the driving video. In this paper, we present DisPose to mine more

    generalizable and effective control signals without additional dense input,

    which disentangles the sparse skeleton pose in human image animation into

    motion field guidance and keypoint correspondence. Specifically, we generate a

    dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, which

    provides region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalization of

    the sparse pose control. We also extract diffusion features corresponding to

    pose keypoints from the reference image, and then these point features are

    transferred to the target pose to provide distinct identity information. To

    seamlessly integrate into existing models, we propose a plug-and-play hybrid

    ControlNet that improves the quality and consistency of generated videos while

    freezing the existing model parameters. Extensive qualitative and quantitative

    experiments demonstrate the superiority of DisPose compared to current methods.

  abstract: 'With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein

    discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces

    promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has

    not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to

    alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and

    trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This

    paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this

    opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated

    Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target

    phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended

    novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse

    simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a

    diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life,

    Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential

    of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids

    lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway''s Game

    of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of

    previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm

    promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human

    ingenuity alone.'
