    algorithm is to train many different models on the same data and then to

    average their predictions. Unfortunately, making predictions using a whole

    ensemble of models is cumbersome and may be too computationally expensive to

    allow deployment to a large number of users, especially if the individual

    models are large neural nets. Caruana and his collaborators have shown that it

    is possible to compress the knowledge in an ensemble into a single model which

    is much easier to deploy and we develop this approach further using a different

    compression technique. We achieve some surprising results on MNIST and we show

    that we can significantly improve the acoustic model of a heavily used

    commercial system by distilling the knowledge in an ensemble of models into a

    single model. We also introduce a new type of ensemble composed of one or more

    full models and many specialist models which learn to distinguish fine-grained

    classes that the full models confuse. Unlike a mixture of experts, these

    using highly flexible families of probability distributions in which learning,

    sampling, inference, and evaluation are still analytically or computationally

    statistical physics, is to systematically and slowly destroy structure in a

    data distribution through an iterative forward diffusion process. We then learn

    a reverse diffusion process that restores structure in data, yielding a highly

    flexible and tractable generative model of the data. This approach allows us to

    rapidly learn, sample from, and evaluate probabilities in deep generative

    models with thousands of layers or time steps, as well as to compute

    bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also

    distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically

    well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep

    explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable

    ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this

    hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of

    In this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of

    parameter space. For example, by optimizing only 200 trainable parameters

    randomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to

    achieve 90\% of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we

    empirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension

    and, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension

    after a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their

    extreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low

  abstract: 'Networks of weakly coupled oscillators had a profound impact on our

    understanding of complex systems. Studies on model reconstruction from data

    have shown prevalent contributions from hypernetworks with triplet and higher

    interactions among oscillators, in spite that such models were originally

    defined as oscillator networks with pairwise interactions. Here, we show that

    hypernetworks can spontaneously emerge even in the presence of pairwise albeit

    nonlinear coupling given certain triplet frequency resonance conditions. The

    results are demonstrated in experiments with electrochemical oscillators and in

    simulations with integrate-and-fire neurons. By developing a comprehensive

    theory, we uncover the mechanism for emergent hypernetworks by identifying

    appearing and forbidden frequency resonant conditions. Furthermore, it is shown

    that microscopic linear (difference) coupling among units results in coupled

    mean fields, which have sufficient nonlinearity to facilitate hypernetworks.

    Our findings shed light on the apparent abundance of hypernetworks and provide

    a constructive way to predict and engineer their emergence.'

  abstract: 'At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are
    not

    well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that

    training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to

    gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple

    weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced

    by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on
    a

    regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when

    training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the

    models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the

    weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained

    Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in

    their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression

    problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context

    learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore

    identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by

    learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data

    representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss

    intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context

    learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be

    understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent

    learning within Transformers. Code to reproduce the experiments can be found at

  abstract: 'Transfer learning has recently become the dominant paradigm of machine

    learning. Pre-trained models fine-tuned for downstream tasks achieve better

    performance with fewer labelled examples. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how

    to develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring

    negative interference and that generalise systematically to non-identically

    distributed tasks. Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to

    these challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented

    as autonomous parameter-efficient modules. Information is conditionally routed

    to a subset of modules and subsequently aggregated. These properties enable

    positive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from

    routing and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular

    architectures, providing a unified view over several threads of research that

    evolved independently in the scientific literature. Moreover, we explore

    various additional purposes of modularity, including scaling language models,

    causal inference, programme induction, and planning in reinforcement learning.

    Finally, we report various concrete applications where modularity has been

    successfully deployed such as cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer.

  abstract: 'Protecting personal data against exploitation of machine learning models
    is

    crucial. Recently, availability attacks have shown great promise to provide an

    extra layer of protection against the unauthorized use of data to train neural

    networks. These methods aim to add imperceptible noise to clean data so that

    the neural networks cannot extract meaningful patterns from the protected data,

    claiming that they can make personal data "unexploitable." This paper provides

    a strong countermeasure against such approaches, showing that unexploitable

    data might only be an illusion. In particular, we leverage the power of

    diffusion models and show that a carefully designed denoising process can

    counteract the effectiveness of the data-protecting perturbations. We

    rigorously analyze our algorithm, and theoretically prove that the amount of

    required denoising is directly related to the magnitude of the data-protecting

    perturbations. Our approach, called AVATAR, delivers state-of-the-art

    performance against a suite of recent availability attacks in various

    scenarios, outperforming adversarial training even under distribution mismatch

    between the diffusion model and the protected data. Our findings call for more

    research into making personal data unexploitable, showing that this goal is far

    from over. Our implementation is available at this repository:

  abstract: 'Generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a leading approach
    for

    generating high-dimensional data. In this paper, we show that the dynamics of

    these models exhibit a spontaneous symmetry breaking that divides the

    generative dynamics into two distinct phases: 1) A linear steady-state dynamics

    around a central fixed-point and 2) an attractor dynamics directed towards the

    data manifold. These two "phases" are separated by the change in stability of

    the central fixed-point, with the resulting window of instability being

    responsible for the diversity of the generated samples. Using both theoretical

    and empirical evidence, we show that an accurate simulation of the early

    dynamics does not significantly contribute to the final generation, since early

    fluctuations are reverted to the central fixed point. To leverage this insight,

    we propose a Gaussian late initialization scheme, which significantly improves

    model performance, achieving up to 3x FID improvements on fast samplers, while

    also increasing sample diversity (e.g., racial composition of generated CelebA

    times by orders of magnitude. While these methods demonstrate state-of-the-art

    quality and speed, they are designed for photogrammetry of static scenes and do

    not generalize well to freely moving humans in the environment. In this work,

    we introduce Human Gaussian Splats (HUGS) that represents an animatable human

    together with the scene using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Our method takes

    only a monocular video with a small number of (50-100) frames, and it

    automatically learns to disentangle the static scene and a fully animatable

    human avatar within 30 minutes. We utilize the SMPL body model to initialize

    the human Gaussians. To capture details that are not modeled by SMPL (e.g.

    cloth, hairs), we allow the 3D Gaussians to deviate from the human body model.

    Utilizing 3D Gaussians for animated humans brings new challenges, including the

    artifacts created when articulating the Gaussians. We propose to jointly

    optimize the linear blend skinning weights to coordinate the movements of

    individual Gaussians during animation. Our approach enables novel-pose

  abstract: 'Text-to-video (T2V) models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating

    the generally degraded style fidelity. To address these challenges, we

    introduce StyleCrafter, a generic method that enhances pre-trained T2V models

    providing a reference image. Considering the scarcity of stylized video

    datasets, we propose to first train a style control adapter using style-rich

    image datasets, then transfer the learned stylization ability to video

    generation through a tailor-made finetuning paradigm. To promote content-style

    disentanglement, we remove style descriptions from the text prompt and extract

    helps generalization across various text and style combinations. StyleCrafter

    efficiently generates high-quality stylized videos that align with the content

  abstract: 'While the impressive performance of modern neural networks is often

    attributed to their capacity to efficiently extract task-relevant features from

    data, the mechanisms underlying this rich feature learning regime remain

    elusive, with much of our theoretical understanding stemming from the opposing

    lazy regime. In this work, we derive exact solutions to a minimal model that

    transitions between lazy and rich learning, precisely elucidating how

    unbalanced layer-specific initialization variances and learning rates determine

    the degree of feature learning. Our analysis reveals that they conspire to

    influence the learning regime through a set of conserved quantities that

    constrain and modify the geometry of learning trajectories in parameter and

    function space. We extend our analysis to more complex linear models with

    multiple neurons, outputs, and layers and to shallow nonlinear networks with

    piecewise linear activation functions. In linear networks, rapid feature

    learning only occurs from balanced initializations, where all layers learn at

    similar speeds. While in nonlinear networks, unbalanced initializations that

    promote faster learning in earlier layers can accelerate rich learning. Through

    a series of experiments, we provide evidence that this unbalanced rich regime

    drives feature learning in deep finite-width networks, promotes

    interpretability of early layers in CNNs, reduces the sample complexity of

    learning hierarchical data, and decreases the time to grokking in modular

    arithmetic. Our theory motivates further exploration of unbalanced

    initializations to enhance efficient feature learning.'

  abstract: 'Enabling LLMs to improve their outputs by using more test-time computation
    is

    a critical step towards building generally self-improving agents that can

    operate on open-ended natural language. In this paper, we study the scaling of

    inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if

    an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time

    compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt?

    Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance

    of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff

    inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little

    research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time

    inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for

    a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms

    to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based

    verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model''s distribution over a

    response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases,

    the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute

    critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation

    motivates applying a "compute-optimal" scaling strategy, which acts to most

    effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this

    compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute

    scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a

    FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model

    attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to

    outperform a 14x larger model.'

    comprehensive and self-contained review of FM, covering its mathematical

    foundations, design choices, and extensions. By also providing a PyTorch

    package featuring relevant examples (e.g., image and text generation), this

    work aims to serve as a resource for both novice and experienced researchers

    interested in understanding, applying and further developing FM.'

  abstract: 'Learning to understand dynamic 3D scenes from imagery is crucial for

    applications ranging from robotics to scene reconstruction. Yet, unlike other

    problems where large-scale supervised training has enabled rapid progress,

    directly supervising methods for recovering 3D motion remains challenging due

    to the fundamental difficulty of obtaining ground truth annotations. We present

    a system for mining high-quality 4D reconstructions from internet stereoscopic,

    wide-angle videos. Our system fuses and filters the outputs of camera pose

    estimation, stereo depth estimation, and temporal tracking methods into

    high-quality dynamic 3D reconstructions. We use this method to generate

    large-scale data in the form of world-consistent, pseudo-metric 3D point clouds

    with long-term motion trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of this data by

    training a variant of DUSt3R to predict structure and 3D motion from real-world

    image pairs, showing that training on our reconstructed data enables

    generalization to diverse real-world scenes. Project page:

  abstract: 'Could an AI have conscious experiences? Any answer to this question should

    conform to Evidentialism - that is, it should be based not on intuition, dogma

    or speculation but on solid scientific evidence. I argue that such evidence is

    hard to come by and that the only justifiable stance on the prospects of

    artificial consciousness is agnosticism. In the current debate, the main

    division is between biological views that are sceptical of artificial

    consciousness and functional views that are sympathetic to it. I argue that

    both camps make the same mistake of over-estimating what the evidence tells us.

    Scientific insights into consciousness have been achieved through the study of

    conscious organisms. Although this has enabled cautious assessments of

    consciousness in various creatures, extending this to AI faces serious

    obstacles. AI thus presents consciousness researchers with a dilemma: either

    reach a verdict on artificial consciousness but violate Evidentialism; or

    respect Evidentialism but offer no verdict on the prospects of artificial

    consciousness. The dominant trend in the literature has been to take the first

    option while purporting to follow the scientific evidence. I argue that if we

    truly follow the evidence, we must take the second option and adopt

    agnosticism.'

  abstract: 'Encoder-only transformer models such as BERT offer a great performance-size

    tradeoff for retrieval and classification tasks with respect to larger

    decoder-only models. Despite being the workhorse of numerous production

    pipelines, there have been limited Pareto improvements to BERT since its

    release. In this paper, we introduce ModernBERT, bringing modern model

    optimizations to encoder-only models and representing a major Pareto

    improvement over older encoders. Trained on 2 trillion tokens with a native

    8192 sequence length, ModernBERT models exhibit state-of-the-art results on a

    large pool of evaluations encompassing diverse classification tasks and both

    single and multi-vector retrieval on different domains (including code). In

    addition to strong downstream performance, ModernBERT is also the most speed

    and memory efficient encoder and is designed for inference on common GPUs.'

  abstract: 'With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein

    discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces

    promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has

    not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to

    alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and

    trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This

    paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this

    opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated

    Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target

    phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended

    novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse

    simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a

    diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life,

    Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential

    of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids

    lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway''s Game

    of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of

    previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm

    promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human

    ingenuity alone.'
