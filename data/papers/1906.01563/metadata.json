  "abstract": "Even though neural networks enjoy widespread use, they still struggle to\nlearn the basic laws of physics. How might we endow them with better inductive\nbiases? In this paper, we draw inspiration from Hamiltonian mechanics to train\nmodels that learn and respect exact conservation laws in an unsupervised\nmanner. We evaluate our models on problems where conservation of energy is\nimportant, including the two-body problem and pixel observations of a pendulum.\nOur model trains faster and generalizes better than a regular neural network.\nAn interesting side effect is that our model is perfectly reversible in time.",
