\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we explored scaling data valuations with influence functions to billion-scale models and datasets as a potential technical solution to properly credit or compensate data providers for training LLMs. Toward this goal, we developed a novel gradient projection algorithm that can significantly improve the scalability of influence functions, and designed a simple and interoperable software. Our experiments showed that \method\ achieves competitive accuracy to other more expensive baselines on counterfactual evaluations, while efficiently scaling to billion-scale models and datasets, thereby demonstrating the initial potential of the practical data valuation system. Last but not least, we discuss broader impacts and limitations of our work in Appendix~\ref{sec:neurips}.
