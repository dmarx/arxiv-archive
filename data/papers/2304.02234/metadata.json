  "title": "JPEG Compressed Images Can Bypass Protections Against AI Editing",
  "authors": "Pedro Sandoval-Segura, Jonas Geiping, Tom Goldstein",
  "abstract": "Recently developed text-to-image diffusion models make it easy to edit or\ncreate high-quality images. Their ease of use has raised concerns about the\npotential for malicious editing or deepfake creation. Imperceptible\nperturbations have been proposed as a means of protecting images from malicious\nediting by preventing diffusion models from generating realistic images.\nHowever, we find that the aforementioned perturbations are not robust to JPEG\ncompression, which poses a major weakness because of the common usage and\navailability of JPEG. We discuss the importance of robustness for additive\nimperceptible perturbations and encourage alternative approaches to protect\nimages against editing.",
