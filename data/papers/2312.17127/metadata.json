  "abstract": "We study semantic models of probabilistic programming languages over graphs,\nand establish a connection to graphons from graph theory and combinatorics. We\nshow that every well-behaved equational theory for our graph probabilistic\nprogramming language corresponds to a graphon, and conversely, every graphon\narises in this way.\n  We provide three constructions for showing that every graphon arises from an\nequational theory. The first is an abstract construction, using Markov\ncategories and monoidal indeterminates. The second and third are more concrete.\nThe second is in terms of traditional measure theoretic probability, which\ncovers 'black-and-white' graphons. The third is in terms of probability monads\non the nominal sets of Gabbay and Pitts. Specifically, we use a variation of\nnominal sets induced by the theory of graphs, which covers Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\ngraphons. In this way, we build new models of graph probabilistic programming\nfrom graphons.",
